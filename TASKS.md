# Project Tasks

This file is the living execution tracker for Gate Challenger Service. Keep it
short enough to scan, and use the detailed Superpowers plan files for module
implementation steps.

Primary plan index:

- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-gate-challenger-service/00-plan-index.md`

## Task Rules

- Use checkbox status: `[ ]` not started, `[~]` in progress, `[x]` done,
  `[!]` blocked.
- Keep active work near the top of the relevant phase.
- Link detailed work to the matching plan file instead of duplicating every
  subtask here.
- Update this file when scope, status, or verification changes.
- Use repository docs, plans, task notes, git history, and nearby code/tests as
  the development context.

## Current Focus

- [~] Automate clean Codex-reviewed PR merges: enabled repository-wide
  automatic and exhaustive Codex reviews on every PR update, and added a
  least-privilege workflow that records every full PR head SHA as trusted
  metadata, resolves Codex's abbreviated clean-review SHA only when it maps to
  exactly one recorded head, and squash-merges only that unchanged commit after
  the required `Verify release` check passes. A later Codex review with findings
  invalidates an earlier clean marker, marker creation races receive a bounded
  retry, and pending checks are retried from the verification workflow's
  completion event instead of a long watcher. Write permissions are scoped per
  job; immediately before merge, the workflow revalidates that no newer Codex
  review/comment findings or PR reopen event supersedes the clean result and
  that its trusted authorization marker still exists. Non-clean comments
  invalidate only their own uniquely resolved full commit SHA. The workflow
  verifies the exact Codex GitHub App identity, performs its last revalidation
  in the same step as the guarded merge, and durably queues deployment before
  merging; the deployment workflow reconciles the resulting merge commit and
  uses a concurrency group separate from PR verification. Activation is pending
  PR merge and successful GitHub Actions completion.
- [x] Automate production releases after verified merges to `main`: added a
  GitHub Actions verification/deploy workflow, release-tagged production images,
  a root-owned server deployer with a restricted SSH entrypoint, immutable
  release directories, serialized deploys, pre-migration PostgreSQL backups,
  Alembic/skill refresh, internal/public health checks, and application rollback.
  Installed the server bootstrap without restarting production, added a read-only
  repository deploy key, configured the `production` environment with a `main`
  branch rule and rotated secrets, protected `main` behind pull requests and
  resolved conversations, rejected a disallowed SSH command, and passed a no-op
  preflight for `ac708f3`. Verified shell/YAML syntax, production Compose config,
  `git diff --check`, full API (`196 passed`) and worker (`155 passed`) suites,
  full web tests (`139 passed`), production web build, production Alembic head,
  internal/public health responses, public login `200`, and unchanged running
  containers. Required `Verify release` for an up-to-date `main`, squash-merged
  PR #4 as `cf1882f`, and completed the first workflow-driven production release:
  release verification passed in 3m09s and the restricted server deploy with
  migrations, skill refresh, health checks, and release switch passed in 2m05s.
- [x] Release merged PR #3 plus the integrated local runtime updates to
  production: pushed `main` through `06ad76b`, exported Gate Challenger source
  `bfe1ee2`, backed up the previous deployment under
  `/opt/gate-challenger/backups/release-06ad76b-20260722085456`, built fresh
  API/worker/web images, applied Alembic migration `202607140001`, refreshed
  eight baseline skills, and recreated the application and edge containers.
  Verified all services running, Alembic at head, internal and public API health
  responses, public login HTTP `200`, the canonical benchmark judge prompt in
  the API container, and clean startup logs.
- [x] Integrate merged PR #3 with the pending local Gate Challenger/runtime
  updates without dropping either change set: fast-forwarded from `212387e` to
  merge commit `4b83db4`, resolved benchmark seed/test and task-log conflicts,
  preserved Result synthesis seeds, and retained a recoverable pre-sync stash.
  Verified focused Python tests (`44 passed`), focused analysis-page tests (`24
  passed`), full API tests (`192 passed`), full worker tests (`155 passed`),
  full web tests (`139 passed`), production web build, Docker Compose config,
  and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Fix run details modal contrast in the Paper light analysis UI: root
  cause was the light-theme override turning `.analysis-chip` cards white while
  nested chip values still used the legacy dark-theme `#f8fafc` color, making
  Provider/Model/Skill/Created and Run trace values nearly invisible in
  production. Scoped readable modal chip, trace-title, and Run parameters
  summary colors in `paperAnalysisOverrides`, added long-value wrapping, and
  covered the regression in `analysisPage.test.ts`. Verified
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- analysisPage` (`20 passed`) and
  `npm --prefix apps/web run build`. Local web container rebuild was attempted
  but blocked because Docker CLI cannot connect to the Colima socket even
  though `colima status` reports the VM running.
- [x] Adapt latest Gate Challenger source update for local service files:
  external source head moved from previously synced `d7323d6` to `bfe1ee2`
  (`Improve gate challenger benchmark reliability`). Updated benchmark judge
  seeding to read the new canonical
  `benchmark/LLM-as-a-judge для оценки.txt` filename while keeping fallback
  compatibility with the legacy `v2` filename; tightened Gate2 runtime output
  requirements for root-cause atomization and exact Layer 2 rubric completeness;
  extended the deterministic DOCX parser to preserve body text, tables,
  headers, footers, comments, and textbox content in parsed artifacts. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_document_parsers.py apps/worker/tests/test_skill_renderers.py apps/api/tests/test_seeds.py apps/worker/tests/test_benchmark_scoring.py apps/worker/tests/test_benchmark_judge_prompt.py -q`
  (`42 passed`, existing Starlette/passlib deprecation warnings). No production
  release or container rebuild was performed in this local file update.
- [x] Close the final PR #3 follow-up before merge: reject `reparse` for linked
  Fin Summary workbooks with `409` so `.xlsx` can never re-enter the generic
  document parser, add regression coverage that preserves the completed
  workbook state without enqueueing a job, and update the canonical IC Review
  plan for the accepted automatic launch, manual relaunch, linked workbook,
  and user-visible Markdown/PDF behavior. Verified focused document upload
  tests (`21 passed`), full API tests (`191 passed`), worker tests (`154
  passed`), web tests (`138 passed`), production web build, Docker Compose
  config, and `git diff --check`.
- [x] Address follow-up PR #3 blockers from 2026-07-21 re-review: linked Fin Summary `.xlsx` uploads are no longer enqueued into the generic document parser and are stored as completed workbook artifacts for IC Review use, while the cancellation regression fixture now includes required provider-result latency metadata. Verified syntax, `git diff --check`, focused API upload tests (`18 passed`), focused worker details tests (`2 passed`), full worker suite (`146 passed`), and full API suite (`185 passed`).
- [x] Address PR #3 review blockers except the explicitly accepted scope item
  about automatic IC Review/user-visible PDF: restored primary upload extension
  allowlist while allowing only valid `.xlsx` Fin Summary attachments, made
  primary+Fin Summary upload and enqueue cleanup compensation non-orphaning,
  guarded main/detail/predicted worker terminal writes so cancellation cannot be
  overwritten by completed/failed races, marks automatic IC Review enqueue
  failures as `failed/enqueue_failed`, records Result summary/rationale provider
  calls as durable `AnalysisCheckStep` traces with prompt artifacts, raw output,
  structured output, and effective parameters, and fixed the Result page
  TypeScript `endIndex` build error plus stale basePath test expectation.
  Verified Docker API tests (`185 passed`), Docker worker tests (`146 passed`),
  focused upload tests (`18 passed`), focused web tests (`24 passed`), and
  production web build with `NODE_ENV=production` (passed). Full web test run
  inside the current compose web image is not representative because that image
  contains only `apps/web` and sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to
  `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, while repo-level tests expect the monorepo root and
  default `localhost` URL.
- [x] Add `Stop Analysis` to the document detail Analysis history running
  state: the button now calls `POST /analyses/{analysis_id}/cancel`, active
  Gate/Devil's Advocate/detail/IC Review runs are marked `cancelled`, completed
  Gate Challenger output remains persisted and openable, and a persisted
  `analysis_chain_cancel_requested_at` marker prevents automatic IC Review from
  being created if the user stops the chain after Gate completion but before the
  IC row exists. Verified Python syntax, Docker API focused tests
  (`18 passed`), Docker worker focused tests (`49 passed`), and focused web
  tests with matching API base URL (`17 passed`). Full TypeScript typecheck is
  still blocked by pre-existing unrelated test fixture type errors in
  `analysisDisplay.test.ts` and `provider-settings.test.ts`.
- [x] Restore deleted Documents-page case row after monitored IC Review
  completion: IC Review run `f7ed2771-279a-491b-b2c9-9db7eed106f0` completed
  successfully, and the missing case was caused by the primary document
  `281867e6-af34-4aea-a375-99d454a893f9` plus linked Fin Summary
  `b2f2e3fc-a8fc-4b6b-9d41-2aa208607495` being marked `deleted`. Restored
  both to `active`, verified the primary document is `active primary completed`,
  analysis `158ee455-6329-4a6c-b763-bcaaeba9a366` is completed, Devil's
  Advocate is completed, IC Review is completed, and stopped the heartbeat
  monitor.
- [x] Fix `Load detailed Layer 1 / Layer 2` precondition mismatch: the UI no
  longer shows the lazy-detail request button when a staged Gate Challenger
  summary lacks `gate_challenger_response_id`, which happens for runs created
  without Responses API conversation state. Full Output now shows a clear
  explanatory message instead of triggering the API error
  `Gate Challenger response id is missing`. Verified focused `analysisPage`
  web test in Docker (`23 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `web`, and checked
  clean startup logs.
- [x] Rename and reorder Full Report subtabs: the second-level tabs now appear
  as `Product Analysis`, `Financial Analysis`, `Document comments`, and
  `Full Output` while preserving the existing underlying panel logic. Verified
  focused `analysisPage` web test in Docker (`23 passed`), rebuilt/restarted
  local `web`, and confirmed the running container has the new tab order.
- [x] Rebuild the Summary page report body into two collapsible blocks:
  `Продуктовый анализ` reuses the Gate Challenger text output and truncates it
  before any `IC Recommendations`/`IC Recomendations` section, while
  `Финансовый анализ` reuses the compact IC Review text output without
  download/artifact controls or uploaded-document UI. Kept the existing verdict
  and `Short Summary` blocks unchanged, verified focused web tests in Docker
  (`48 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `web`, and confirmed the running
  client bundle contains both new block titles.
- [x] Polish Summary report styling: Financial `Executive brief` now uses a
  pure white block and standard dark text, Summary report blocks are white, and
  open disclosure controls use the main button green with a white, heavier
  chevron while the closed state keeps the existing neutral treatment. Verified
  focused `analysisPage` web test in Docker (`22 passed`) and rebuilt/restarted
  local `web`.
- [x] Trim Summary `Продуктовый анализ` content: the Summary-only product
  markdown now removes `Рекомендация инвестиционного комитета` and both
  `Что можно улучшить в документе` / `Что нужно улучшить в документе` sections
  with their nested content, without changing the Gate Challenger tab output.
  Rebuilt/restarted local `web` and verified focused `analysisPage` test in
  Docker (`23 passed`).
- [x] Add source evidence labels to Summary rationale subpoints: result
  rationale synthesis now persists structured `rationale_items` with per-item
  `gate_challenger`/`ic_review` evidence sources, the Summary page renders each
  subpoint with a gray `Источники - Gate Challenger, IC Review` label inside
  the subpoint title row, and legacy markdown remains as fallback. Backfilled local analysis
  `964e2d93-902d-409b-9593-008238fe1dbc` with 6 sourced rationale items.
  Verified Docker API schema/seeds tests (`31 passed`), worker synthesis/job
  tests (`27 passed`), focused web tests (`43 passed` plus `22 passed` after
  moving labels into the title row), rebuilt/restarted local `api`/`worker`/`web`,
  and checked clean web/worker startup logs.
- [x] Update the analysis result page summary surface: renamed the top
  `Executive Summary` tab to `Summary` and expanded the final verdict block
  with two one-line agent verdict rows: `Продуктовый анализ` and
  `Финансовый анализ`. Each row uses the normalized three-state verdict with a
  green/yellow/red circular marker, with IC `CONDITIONAL` rendered as
  `Need Evidence`; statuses now sit next to the row labels instead of being
  pushed to the far edge. Verified focused web tests inside Docker (`26 passed`)
  and rebuilt/restarted local `web`; Docker reports `127.0.0.1:3000->3000/tcp`
  published.
- [x] Fix IC Review `schema_validation_failed:additionalProperties` on
  `ic-product-analyst`: the latest failed local run validated a provider
  chat-completions envelope (`choices`/`usage`/`model`) instead of the nested
  role JSON, and after unwrapping exposed a role-level `primary_verify_notes`
  field that belongs under `full_report_materials`. The shared worker JSON
  parser now unwraps OpenAI-compatible chat/Responses envelopes before schema
  validation and normalizes IC role `primary_verify_notes` into the allowed
  report-materials location. Rebuilt/restarted local `worker`; verified
  `python3 -m py_compile apps/worker/results/schema_validation.py`, focused
  Docker worker tests (`48 passed`), worker startup logs, and direct validation
  of failed step `facdefd9-f5a6-4d75-bfe1-490d15436e84` (`validation ok`,
  role `ic-product-analyst`).
- [x] Split the `/documents` upload surface into two drag-and-drop zones:
  `Документ для защиты` and `Fin Summary`. The API now accepts an optional
  `fin_summary_file`, stores it as a linked `fin_summary` document, keeps the
  primary document as the only row in the normal documents list, and exposes
  linked Fin Summary metadata on document reads for future `Start Analysis`
  wiring. Added migration `202607140001`, rebuilt/restarted local
  `api`/`worker`/`web`, applied Alembic head, and verified
  `tests/test_documents_upload.py` (`18 passed`), relevant web tests
  (`40 passed`), `/health` `200`, and `/documents` `200`.
- [x] Fix IC Review `ic_review_validation_failed` caused by original
  postprocess scripts not finding generated PDF/Excel artifacts: the failed run
  reached validation but `pdf_generator` could not find Cyrillic fonts and
  `excel_audit` expected KPI rows as two-value pairs. The worker now exposes
  snapshotted DejaVu fonts at the legacy PDF script's expected Linux font path
  before PDF generation and serializes legacy KPIs as `[name, value]` pairs for
  the original Excel audit script. Rebuilt/restarted local `worker`; verified
  focused worker tests: `52 passed`.
- [x] Fix recurring IC Review `invalid_json:Unterminated string` after moving
  toward full reports: synthesis no longer asks the LLM to return a large
  `legacy_report_json`. The model now returns only the compact
  `ic-agentic-review-result` UI object, while the worker assembles the full
  PDF/Markdown `legacy_report_json` from role-level `full_report_materials`.
  Reduced synthesis output budget back to `12000`, kept backward-compatible
  parsing for old `compact_result` wrappers, rebuilt/restarted local `worker`,
  and verified focused worker tests: `50 passed`.
- [x] Preserve the current web IC Review logic as a rollback point and switch
  future IC Review full-report generation toward the original full skill
  depth while keeping the existing compact web summary path intact. Saved a
  rollback copy of the touched web/worker contract files under
  `.local/backups/ic-review-web-logic-20260714-1318/` and documented it in
  `docs/handoffs/2026-07-14-ic-review-web-logic-rollback.md`. Added
  role-level `full_report_materials`, expanded synthesis instructions for the
  10-section original-style report, increased IC Review context/report output
  budgets, and updated focused API/worker tests. Verified
  `43 passed` for API contract/IC Review API tests and `50 passed` for
  worker IC Review renderer/job/script tests.
- [x] Restructure the analysis detail output navigation into two levels without
  changing result calculation or panel content: the top level now has
  `Executive Summary` and `Full Report`, `Executive Summary` reuses the former
  Result panel and is selected by default, and `Full Report` reveals nested
  `Gate Challenger`, `Document comments`, `IC review`, and `Full Output` tabs
  with `Gate Challenger` selected by default. Verified focused web tests and
  rebuilt/restarted the local `web` container.
- [x] Add Result tab rationale synthesis block: compare Gate Challenger
  `Почему оценка именно такая` with IC Review `Top findings`, synthesize the
  merged explanation into the same Result-tab surface, and append IC Review
  `Critical risks` plus `Data gaps`. Added the persisted
  `result_rationale_synthesis` path with
  `contracts/schemas/result-rationale.schema.json`, seeded the local DB skill,
  wired the worker to run it after completed IC Review, backfilled local
  analysis `964e2d93-902d-409b-9593-008238fe1dbc`, rebuilt/restarted
  `api`/`worker`/`web`, and verified targeted API/worker/frontend tests.
- [x] Set Result verdict block text color to `#161616` for both the label and
  verdict text. Verified `npm run test -- analysisPage resultDisplay` inside
  the web container (`22 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `web`, and confirmed
  the target analysis page returns `200`.
- [x] Apply user-provided Result verdict colors: updated the Result tab verdict
  block to use muted variants of `B4CB75` for `Approved`, `FFCE69` for
  `Need Evidence`, and `EF6D4E` for `Rejected`. Verified
  `npm run test -- analysisPage resultDisplay` inside the web container
  (`22 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `web` with Docker Compose, and
  confirmed the target analysis page returns `200`.
- [x] Add initial analysis `Result` tab for aggregated business verdict:
  inserted a first-level `Result` tab before `Gate Challenger` on the analysis
  detail page and made it the default active tab. The tab currently renders only
  one muted color verdict block with `Rejected`, `Need Evidence`, or `Approved`.
  The verdict is the strictest available value across Gate Challenger and the
  latest completed IC Review compact output: IC `GO` maps to `Approved`,
  `CONDITIONAL`/`UNKNOWN` to `Need Evidence`, and `NO-GO`/`FREEZE` to
  `Rejected`; Gate verdicts are normalized into the same three states. Added
  focused unit coverage in `resultDisplay.test.ts` and updated analysis page
  tab tests. Verified inside the rebuilt web container:
  `npm run test -- analysisPage resultDisplay` (`22 passed`), rebuilt/restarted
  local `web` with Docker Compose, and confirmed
  `/analyses/964e2d93-902d-409b-9593-008238fe1dbc` returns `200` with clean
  compile logs. Note: standalone `npm run build` still hits the pre-existing
  Next `/404` `<Html>` import prerender error after successful compile/typecheck.
- [x] Create GitHub rollback branch for the saved local site checkpoint:
  pushed the current project source state, without `.env`, `.local`, logs,
  local databases, uploaded documents, or build artifacts, to
  `Feercopy/Gate-Challenger-Seva` branch `Jul14-0932` for a readable restore
  point in addition to the local rollback archive and Docker image tags.
- [x] Save local rollback checkpoint for the current site before further edits:
  created source archive
  `.local/rollback-snapshots/site-20260714-092236/project-source-no-secrets.tar.gz`
  excluding `.env` and prior rollback snapshots, with SHA-256
  `cae799240fbbfcb33dbb3aa6e9d56b8d85bbe9785cd5dba9dbe56f9caa208f9f`.
  Tagged current local Docker images as
  `gate-challenger-local-web:rollback-20260714-092236`,
  `gate-challenger-local-api:rollback-20260714-092236`, and
  `gate-challenger-local-worker:rollback-20260714-092236`. Wrote restore notes
  to `.local/rollback-snapshots/site-20260714-092236/MANIFEST.md`.
- [x] Fix local IC Review synthesis `invalid_json:Unterminated string` failure:
  root cause was the final synthesis step returning malformed/truncated JSON
  after all role calls had already completed. Tightened the synthesis prompt so
  `legacy_report_json` stays a concise shell that the worker deterministically
  expands from `compact_result`, added a `20000` token synthesis output default,
  and added one automatic synthesis-only retry on `JSONDecodeError` without
  rerunning the eight role steps. The retry records safe metadata in
  `run_parameters["synthesis_json_retry"]` and preserves the successful retry
  raw output in the normal admin-only raw field. Rebuilt/restarted local
  `worker`; verified inside Docker after temporary `pytest` install:
  `python -m pytest tests/test_run_ic_agentic_review_job.py
  tests/test_ic_review_renderer.py -q` (`39 passed`).
- [x] Diagnose local Quotio Codex auth after `gpt-5.5` returned
  `auth_unavailable`: direct minimal Quotio probes showed the failure was inside
  Quotio/CLIProxy Codex OAuth, not the Gate Challenger request shape. Immediately
  after account relogin, one `gpt-5.5` request still returned an invalidated
  OAuth-token error, while `claude-opus-4-7` worked. The refreshed Codex auth
  file then became usable; follow-up probes for `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.5` both
  returned `200` with `ok`, and a final `gpt-5.5` repeat also returned `200`.
  Keep the GPT models available; if the error recurs, reauthenticate the Codex
  provider in Quotio and wait/retry once before changing service code.
- [x] Fix local Quotio Gate Challenger malformed JSON after switching off
  Responses API: the follow-up failure
  `Expecting ',' delimiter: line 1 column 77435` came from sending the full
  large Gate Challenger result schema through chat completions. The worker now
  separates the compact Gate Challenger summary schema choice from the transport
  choice: Gate Challenger uses the compact summary schema for both official
  OpenAI Responses and local/custom OpenAI-compatible chat providers, while
  `http://host.docker.internal:8317/v1` still avoids Responses API. Added an
  end-to-end worker regression for Quotio-style base URL using chat completions
  with the summary schema. Rebuilt/restarted local `worker`; verified
  `python -m pytest tests/test_run_analysis_job.py tests/test_provider_adapters.py -q`
  inside Docker (`24 passed`, existing passlib/argon2 warnings) and confirmed a
  fresh local run would use `summary_schema=True`, `responses_api=False`.
- [x] Fix local Quotio/OpenAI-compatible Gate Challenger run using the wrong
  provider API: root cause of the `messages: at least one message is required`
  failure was automatic use of OpenAI Responses API for Gate Challenger summary
  runs even when `base_url` was the local Quotio bridge
  `http://host.docker.internal:8317/v1`. Quotio accepts the OpenAI-compatible
  chat-completions shape for Claude model IDs, but the Responses request sends
  `input` instead of `messages`. The worker now auto-selects Responses only for
  the official OpenAI base URL (or an explicit `provider_api: responses`
  override) and uses chat completions for local/custom OpenAI-compatible
  providers. Added regression coverage for the Quotio base URL and explicit
  override behavior. Rebuilt/restarted the local `worker` container and verified
  inside Docker: `python -m pytest tests/test_run_analysis_job.py
  tests/test_provider_adapters.py -q` (`23 passed`, existing passlib/argon2
  warnings) plus a live metadata check showing a fresh run with
  `claude-opus-4-7` and `http://host.docker.internal:8317/v1` no longer selects
  Responses API.
- [x] Fix local Gate Challenger skill-source mount for parser runs: SSH access
  to `git@github.com:Ilya-eremenko/Gate2-challenger-skill.git` works, cloned
  the repo to `.local/git-sources/Gate2-challenger-skill`, and pointed local
  `.env` `GATE_CHALLENGER_HOST_PATH` at that git copy. Added `git` to the API
  Docker image because `local_git_repo` source snapshots run `git rev-parse`
  during analysis creation. Rebuilt/restarted the local `api` container,
  recreated `worker`, verified the API container sees
  `/external/gate-challenger/skills/gate-challenger/SKILL.md`, collects a
  `10`-file manifest including `stream-review-2-plus-rubric.md`, and passes
  `check_git_freshness` at revision
  `bfe1ee2203928c0e8c06ebba6f5ed274dd5252cf` with `dirty=False`. Local note:
  the source clone's branch upstream tracking is unset because the compose mount
  is intentionally read-only and `git fetch` would otherwise try to write
  `.git/FETCH_HEAD` inside the container.
- [x] Adapt latest Gate Challenger reference updates for service runtime:
  external source head moved from previously synced `a738279` to `d7323d6`,
  adding strategic spine / driver focus / vision-metric coupling checks across
  Gate 2, Stream Review, Gate 3, and common adversarial rubrics. The service
  already snapshots the full reference directory, so fresh runs will carry the
  new rubric content; updated the worker prompt frame from five-pass to
  six-pass language and tightened unknown-stage reference filtering so the
  service no longer preloads all stage-specific rubrics before routing. Added
  renderer regression coverage for strategic-spine content and unknown-stage
  filtering. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_skill_renderers.py -q`
  (`14 passed`) and
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_skill_renderers.py apps/worker/tests/test_run_analysis_job.py -q`
  (`22 passed`, existing `passlib/argon2` deprecation warning). Released code
  commit `a361855` to production: pushed `main`, created backup
  `/opt/gate-challenger/backups/release-a361855-20260711190435`, synced the
  release tree, updated the production Gate Challenger source export from clean
  external skill head `d7323d6`, rebuilt/recreated `worker`, and verified
  container status, direct API health, public `/doc-challanger/api/health`,
  public `/doc-challanger/login`, production worker renderer behavior, source
  export strategic-spine content, and fresh worker logs.
- [x] Fix production IC Agentic Review source path: root cause was
  `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml` missing `IC_AGENTIC_REVIEW_SOURCE_PATH` and
  the `/external/ic-agentic-review` readonly mount, so production skill seeds
  fell back to the local macOS path
  `/Users/iseremenko/Documents/IC-Agentic-Review`. Added the prod env/mount for
  `api` and `worker`, added regression coverage in `basePathRouting.test.ts`,
  copied a clean `IC-Agentic-Review` source tree plus Git metadata to
  `/opt/gate-challenger/external/ic-agentic-review`, set
  `IC_AGENTIC_REVIEW_HOST_PATH` in production `infra/.env` with a backup,
  recreated `api`, `worker`, and `edge`, re-ran skill seeds, and verified the DB
  source path is `/external/ic-agentic-review`, the API container can collect
  the source manifest (`26` files), public health returns 200, and fresh
  API/worker logs are clean.
- [x] Deploy IC Agentic Review release to production: merged
  `codex/ic-agentic-review-check` into `main`, pushed `main` to origin,
  synchronized a clean `git archive` release tree to `178.250.159.250`,
  rebuilt production `api`, `worker`, and `web`, applied Alembic migration
  `202607090001`, refreshed skill seeds (`baseline skills ready: 6`),
  force-recreated `edge`, and verified container status, Alembic head, direct
  API health, canonical `/doc-challanger/api/health`, `/doc-challanger/login`,
  and fresh API/worker/edge logs.
- [x] Adjust document detail narrow-screen layout: when the document detail
  columns collapse, the `Analysis history` panel now renders above the parsed
  document text via responsive grid item ordering. Verified
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- responsive-ui modelTrigger documents` (`39
  passed`), `npm --prefix apps/web run build`, and rebuilt/restarted the local
  `web` container.
- [x] Simplify IC review analysis-tab UI: hid the launch controls while an
  IC review run is queued/running, removed duplicate provider/model/created
  run chips, moved active-run progress into one compact status row inside the
  tab, stopped showing the page-level "Finishing analysis" banner for IC-only
  background runs while preserving polling, and changed the launch button back
  to the page's normal primary button styling. Follow-up polish styled the
  native `.xlsx` file-selector button to match the same compact control system,
  then removed the visible Provider selector and promoted financial-model
  upload into a wider, more discoverable `.xlsx` control while preserving the
  automatic provider/model launch parameters.
  Verified
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- analysisPage icReviewDisplay` (`24
  passed`), `npm --prefix apps/web run build`, and rebuilt/restarted the local
  `web` container.
- [x] Reduce IC Agentic Review token cost with deterministic context packing:
  added an `ic_review_context_pack_v1` worker layer that replaces repeated full
  document/main-analysis payloads in role and synthesis prompts with a bounded
  evidence index, role-specific evidence slices, compact main-analysis/detail
  context, and optional workbook/formula context. The worker now saves
  `structured/context_pack.json` plus a fingerprint for reproducibility and
  passes the same pack to all 8 roles and synthesis, while raw provider outputs,
  synthesis prompt/raw, postprocess log, validation report, and deterministic
  artifacts remain preserved. Verified

  apps/worker/tests/test_ic_review_script_runner.py
  apps/worker/tests/test_provider_adapters.py -q` (`61 passed`). Rebuilt and
  restarted the local `worker` container with Docker Compose and verified the
  container imports `ic_review.context_pack`.
- [x] Configure local Docker Compose proxy env for
  `206.223.244.175:1080`: copied the production `OUTBOUND_PROXY_URL` credentials
  from `/opt/gate-challenger/current/infra/.env` into gitignored local `.env`
  and `infra/.env` without printing the secret. Recreated local `api` and
  `worker` without rebuild so the new env is present, re-applied the worker
  timeout hotfix files after recreation, and restarted worker. Root-caused the
  first local proxy failure to Dante ACLs on `206.223.244.175`: only
  `178.250.159.250/32` was allowed, while local container traffic arrived as
  `37.113.208.129`. Added `37.113.208.129/32` to both `client pass` and
  `socks pass` in `/etc/danted.conf` with backup
  `/etc/danted.conf.bak-local-20260710120738`, restarted `danted`, and verified
  worker egress through the proxy to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`
  returns `200 application/json`. Worker also sees IC review timeout defaults
  `600/30/3`.
- [x] Fix local IC review `a_p_i_timeout_error` on run
  `c53534ed-2709-4901-850d-0a5bb2b85ce8`: root cause was an
  OpenAI-compatible provider timeout on role `ic-product-analyst`, not legacy
  postprocess/PDF generation. The previous role completed with a larger prompt
  (`82.8s`, `34.8k` input tokens), while `ic-product-analyst` failed after
  `16.3s` with no raw provider output, matching SDK/proxy connect timeout
  behavior. The OpenAI-compatible adapter now passes `timeout_seconds`,
  `connect_timeout_seconds`, and `max_retries` into the OpenAI SDK and proxy
  HTTP client, and IC review role/synthesis calls default to `600s` total,
  `30s` connect timeout, and `3` retries while preserving explicit overrides.

  apps/worker/tests/test_ic_review_script_runner.py
  apps/worker/tests/test_ic_review_renderer.py
  apps/worker/tests/test_provider_adapters.py -q` (`58 passed`). Local Docker
  image rebuild is temporarily blocked by `mirror.gcr.io` metadata connection
  refusal; copied the changed worker files into the running `infra-worker-1`
  container and restarted it, then verified inside the container that role and
  synthesis defaults are `600/30/3`. A direct worker egress probe to
  `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models` currently returns `ConnectTimeout` with
  no local `OUTBOUND_PROXY_URL` configured, so new runs may still fail if local
  network access to OpenRouter remains unavailable.
- [x] Restore full IC review report artifacts while keeping the compact web
  summary: synthesis now asks for both `compact_result` and full
  10-section `legacy_report_json`, the deterministic runner writes
  `legacy_report.md`, runs the source `pdf_generator.py`, validates with
  `--pdf`, and persists user-visible `legacy_report_markdown` and
  `legacy_report_pdf` artifacts. The IC Review tab still renders compact
  summary content and exposes download links for the full PDF/MD files.

  restarted runtime `api`, `web`, and `worker`; all are up locally.
- [x] Move IC Review full-report downloads above `Executive brief` and localize
  the block to `Скачать полный отчет` with `Скачать PDF` / `Скачать MD`
  buttons. Backfilled analysis `964e2d93-902d-409b-9593-008238fe1dbc` latest
  completed IC run `127a8acd-183f-4fc6-a533-2f3892ac8e1b` with user-visible

- [x] Fix local IC review deterministic validation failure on run
  `cb6c52c9-e949-43f3-8427-f33f2b2aca43`: root cause was not provider output
  generation but legacy-script compatibility after synthesis. The compact
  result was valid, while the legacy payload had `scenarios` as a list and
  empty sections; the original `json_postprocess.py` / `validate_report.py`
  expect `scenarios` as an object. The worker now converts
  legacy scenarios to script-compatible objects, fills empty legacy sections
  from the compact result for internal artifact generation, while keeping raw
  synthesis output unchanged. Verified

  apps/worker/tests/test_provider_adapters.py -q` (`56 passed`), rebuilt the
  local worker container, and safely replay-ran the deterministic script
  pipeline on the stored synthesis raw without model/document re-send
  (`json_postprocess` and `validate_report` exit `0`; validation has `0`
  failures).
- [x] Fix local IC review synthesis wrapper validation on run
  `f5636d12-ed1d-49e2-acaf-90e8db44c4c8`: root cause was a valid provider
  synthesis that returned compact output plus a legacy report shell, but the
  compact `role_summaries[].summary` exceeded the UI schema `maxLength` and the
  legacy `sections` object was empty. The worker now normalizes legacy sections
  before deterministic scripts and trims compact-result strings according to
  schema `maxLength` before local validation, while preserving the original raw
  synthesis output separately. Verified

  local worker container, and safely replay-validated the stored synthesis raw
  without printing document/model text (`8` role summaries, max summary length
  `500`, `10` legacy sections).
- [x] Fix local IC review synthesis `bad_request_error` on run
  `cf34574c-db6f-47b0-9770-6a2be56a16bd`: root cause was the OpenAI-compatible
  provider rejecting Anthropic/OpenRouter `response_format` JSON Schema for the
  synthesis wrapper. The compact result schema used numeric `minimum`/`maximum`
  bounds, and the nested compact schema kept `$ref` values that provider-side
  validation resolved against a wrapper root without `$defs`. Extended provider
  schema normalization to strip unsupported numeric bounds while preserving
  local contract validation, hoisted compact-result `$defs` to the synthesis
  wrapper root, rebuilt the local worker, and verified a minimal provider probe
  with the same model/schema succeeds without document text. Also fixed the IC
  review failed banner separator so UI no longer renders
  `IC review failedbad_request_error`, and rebuilt the local web container.

- [x] Fix Stream Review auto-detection regression found on local document
  `e1bcfea7-e0c2-4ab8-9364-d7049354e843`: root cause was an overly strict
  detector that ignored unnumbered `Stream review` titles unless they matched
  exact `1st Stream Review` / `Stream review 2+` phrases. Added weak generic
  Stream Review signals that still require stage-supporting evidence, verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_document_type_detector.py -q`
  (`7 passed`, existing warning), rebuilt local API/worker containers, and
  reparsed the document; it now stores `stream_review_1`, confidence `0.45`,
  with parse status `completed`.
- [x] Implement Task 10 Analysis Page IC Review Tab: added manual `IC review`
  analysis tab between document comments and full output, configured
  provider/model and output-language controls, optional client-validated
  `.xlsx` upload, completed-analysis launch gate, active-run polling via
  embedded `ic_review_run`, current-stage display, compact completed-result
  rendering without raw/admin artifacts, failed-run relaunch support, file-input
  reset after launch/invalid upload, and pure display helper coverage. Verified
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- analysisPage icReviewDisplay`

- [x] Implement Task 11 IC Agentic Review verification/regression suite:
  reviewed acceptance risks, fixed worker error-message sanitization so
  `jsonschema.ValidationError` / unknown provider exceptions cannot persist
  rejected provider instances into user-visible IC review errors while raw
  outputs remain preserved separately, and added regression coverage for role
  and full worker-job schema failures. Verified

  `docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d --build web` after starting
  Colima (rebuilt/restarted local `infra-api` and `infra-web`; Docker `npm ci`
  reported 2 moderate audit warnings).
- [x] Implement Task 9 Frontend API Client for IC Agentic Review: added
  frontend shared IC review run/step/result types, embedded
  `AnalysisRecord.ic_review_run`, FormData-based launch client with optional
  `.xlsx` file omission when absent, and read/list/latest endpoint helpers.
  Verified `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- documents` (`30 passed`).
- [x] Implement Task 8 API read model embedding for IC Agentic Review: main
  `AnalysisRead` now includes the latest `ic_agentic_review` check run via the
  existing sanitized/admin-aware IC review serializer, so normal users see
  status, compact structured output, and source trace without raw/path fields,
  while admins see raw outputs and artifact path metadata. Review fixes made
  legacy output and role-step structured outputs admin-only, recursively strip
  path-like run parameter keys for non-admins, and added stable latest-run
  ordering. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_ic_review_api.py -q`
  (`19 passed`, existing warnings).
- [x] Implement Task 7 IC Agentic Review worker job: added
  `run_ic_agentic_review` orchestration for queued/running/completed/failed and
  pre-cancelled runs, source snapshot workspace preparation, optional workbook
  snapshot plus formula audit, eight ordered role calls with raw-output
  preservation, synthesis prompt/raw/compact+legacy persistence, legacy JSON
  artifact writing, deterministic script pipeline artifact/log capture,
  validation report parsing, and failed-run preservation after role/provider
  errors. Added focused mocked worker coverage for no-workbook, workbook,
  synthesis prompt/artifact persistence, role raw outputs, script artifacts, and
  provider failure after role 3. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_run_ic_agentic_review_job.py

  Review fixes added atomic queued-only claiming/idempotency, cancelled
  finalization, parent-analysis completion gate in the worker, workbook
  upload-dir boundary checks, DB-owned source snapshot lookup with storage-root
  validation, local synthesis wrapper schema validation, legacy JSON shape/type
  validation before script persistence, bounded subprocess environment for
  deterministic scripts, latest completed detail-run context, single formula
  audit reuse, explicit failed spreadsheet audit persistence including workbook
  extraction failures, deterministic script stage transitions, and regression
  coverage. Verified

- [x] Implement Task 6 prompt rendering and role execution for IC Agentic
  Review: added serializable review context construction, fixed eight-role
  prompt order, snapshot-backed role and synthesis prompt renderers, guarded
  prompt artifact persistence under `ic-review/{analysis_id}/{run_id}/prompts`,
  synthesis wrapper output for compact + legacy JSON, and direct
  provider-backed role step execution with raw-output preservation and schema
  validation, including parent-run failure marking and usage metadata on failed
  role validation. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_ic_review_renderer.py -q`
  (`10 passed`) plus `py_compile`; Task 5+6 worker tests pass together
  (`19 passed`).
- [x] Implement Task 5 worker workbook parser and deterministic IC review
  script runner: added bounded `.xlsx` snapshot extraction, snapshot-to-run
  workspace preparation with path traversal checks, DB-owned run-dir boundaries
  for script inputs/logs/artifacts, no-shell streaming subprocess runner with
  finite timeout and process-group cleanup, bounded stdout/stderr capture,
  validation reports that include stderr and exit metadata on failure,
  workbook/no-workbook script orchestration, worker
  `ic_review*` package discovery, and external runtime dependencies in
  `apps/worker/pyproject.toml`. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_ic_review_script_runner.py

- [x] Implement Task 4 API launch/read/workbook upload for IC Agentic Review:
  added manual IC review run endpoints, completed-analysis gate, provider/model
  allowlist validation, `.xlsx`-only workbook storage under
  `ic-review/{analysis_id}/{run_id}/uploads`, skill source snapshots linked to
  `analysis_check_run_id`, sanitized non-admin read models, and DB-owned
  artifact download lookup. Review fixes added admin-by-default artifact
  download visibility, IC-review run path-prefix enforcement, OpenXML `.xlsx`
  sanity validation, source-snapshot failure upload cleanup, and enqueue-failure
  marking. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_ic_review_api.py -q`

  apps/api/tests/test_skill_sources.py -q` (`20 passed`, existing warnings).
- [x] Implement Task 3 seed for IC Agentic Review skill source: added
  `IC_AGENTIC_REVIEW_SOURCE_PATH`, active `ic-agentic-review` local repo source
  with the required prompt/script/font/data manifest paths, and baseline
  `ic_agentic_review` `analysis_check` skill linked to the source. Added seed
  and temporary-source manifest coverage for the IC entrypoint, all eight agent
  prompts, deterministic scripts, schema path, and Gate Challenger document
  types. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_seeds.py
  apps/api/tests/test_skill_sources.py -q` (`20 passed`, existing warnings).
- [x] Implement Task 2 database foundation for IC Agentic Review checks:
  added `analysis_check_runs` and `analysis_check_steps`, added
  `analysis_check` skill type, extended skill source snapshots to support
  `analysis_check_run_id` with exactly-one-owner enforcement, and added focused
  model persistence coverage. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_ic_review_api.py
  apps/api/tests/test_skill_sources.py -q` (`15 passed`), applied the new
  Alembic migration from previous head `202606180001` to `202607090001`, and
  verified downgrade deletes IC-review-owned snapshots before restoring the old
  two-owner snapshot schema. A fresh full SQLite Alembic upgrade remains
  blocked earlier at existing migration `202606080002`.
- [x] Draft implementation plan for the intermediate IC Agentic Review
  integration requested on 2026-07-09:
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-gate-challenger-service/12-ic-agentic-review-check.md`.
  Scope: manual `IC review` analysis tab, completed-analysis gate, optional
  `.xlsx` upload/audit on that tab, single worker flow using the original IC
  role prompts without subagents, saved role raw outputs, synthesis prompt,
  script logs, validation report, and compact UI-native result.
- [x] Assess `/Users/iseremenko/Documents/IC-Agentic-Review` integration as an
  optional user-requested analysis check. Conclusion: feasible, but should be
  integrated as a separate reproducible auxiliary run with its own schema,
  source snapshot, raw/structured outputs, artifacts, and non-blocking failure
  semantics. Full parity requires package/material support for `.xlsx` inputs
  and a worker-native replacement for the Claude Code multi-agent/desktop
  pipeline; a text-only MVP can run from existing parsed document text with
  reduced financial-audit coverage.
- [x] Audit and refresh Gate Challenger / Devil's Advocate skill sources:
  fetched local upstream refs for
  `/Users/iseremenko/Projects/Gate2-challenger` and
  `/Users/iseremenko/Documents/Common GPTs/devils-advocate`; both local
  checkouts are at `origin/main` (`a738279` for Gate Challenger, `18925f0`
  for Devil's Advocate). Gate Challenger is clean; Devil's Advocate has local
  uncommitted changes, including `ic-voting-prompt.md`, scripts, and
  `wiki-ic/ops/log.md`. Focused verification passed:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_seeds.py
  apps/api/tests/test_skill_sources.py apps/worker/tests/test_skill_renderers.py
  -q` (`27 passed`). Production read-only audit found the app uses
  `snapshot_required` skills and non-stub prompts, but production
  `/opt/gate-challenger/external/gate-challenger/skills/gate-challenger/SKILL.md`
  is older than the local latest source (`eba956...` vs `35e9a4...`), and DA
  required-source manifest also differs from local. After explicit approval,
  created production backup
  `/opt/gate-challenger/backups/skill-source-sync-20260707231535`, verified DA
  required runtime files already matched local canonical source, and updated
  only production Gate `SKILL.md` (no broad `--delete`, no references/DA
  overwrite). Refreshed only production
  `gate2_challenger_main_analysis` DB `prompt_text` and `source_fingerprint`;
  final production service manifests match local (`gate-challenger`
  `87b81d...`, `devils-advocate` `b02cd1...`). Verified production containers
  remained up and server-local plus edge `/health` returned `ok`; reran focused
  local tests (`27 passed`, same existing warnings).
- [x] Route production provider egress through Kazakhstan SOCKS5 proxy:
  installed and configured Dante on `206.223.244.175:1080` with username
  authentication and Dante allow rules for production host `178.250.159.250`.
  Updated production `/opt/gate-challenger/current/infra/.env`
  `OUTBOUND_PROXY_URL` with a root-only backup
  `.env.bak.proxy-20260707224839`, recreated production `api` and `worker`,
  and recreated `edge` to refresh Docker upstreams. Verified from production
  worker that proxied egress resolves to `206.223.244.175`, OpenRouter
  `/api/v1/models` returns `200 application/json` through the proxy, and both
  server-local plus public `/doc-challanger/api/health` return `ok`.
- [x] Reparse production DOCX document
  `dc35942a-eebe-422d-8412-b8eb2df9ee03` after the OOXML parser deployment.
  Triggered reparse through the production API on `178.250.159.250`; worker job
  `ea32f002-5739-4bc3-8c5c-43144f5462b7` completed in about 1 second.
  Verified `parse_status=completed`, `parse_error=None`,
  `detected_document_type=gate_3`, `document_type_confidence=0.85`,
  `parsed_text_len=69852`, markdown headings/tables/ordered lists present,
  `parser_name=ooxml-docx`, `parser_source=zipfile.ElementTree`, `210` blocks,
  and `27` parsed tables. No document text was printed during verification.
- [x] Port DOCX structured markdown extraction from Doc_challanger into the
  worker parser: `.docx` / `.dotx` now use a deterministic OOXML zip parser
  that preserves heading styles, numbered lists, table markdown, escaped pipes,
  `<br>` line breaks, hyperlinks from relationships, gridSpan placeholders, and
  ignores deleted/moveFrom/instrText Word nodes. DOCX `parsed_text` now stores
  the structured markdown contract, while PDF remains Docling-first. Verified
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_document_parsers.py -q`
  (`12 passed`), `.venv/bin/python -m pytest
  apps/worker/tests/test_parse_document_job.py -q` (`2 passed`, one existing
  passlib/argon2 deprecation warning), and `.venv/bin/python -m pytest
  apps/worker/tests -q` (`77 passed`, same warning). Committed as `15ca6c5`,
  pushed to `main`, synced a clean release tree to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt
  production `worker`, and verified production container status, worker logs,
  worker parser import, server-local `/health`, and edge
  `/doc-challanger/api/health`.
- [x] Import 2026-06-25 project handoff into
  `docs/handoffs/2026-06-25-gate-challenger-service.md`: preserved production
  paths, deployment notes, recent commit history, audit findings, and external
  skill-repo context. Reconciled the imported stale dirty-state warning against
  the current clean `main` / `origin/main` at `c46f4b8`, where the
  `Document comments` markdown renderer has already been completed and
  released.
- [x] Render DOCX-derived markdown inside analysis `Document comments`: the
  analysis document/comment view now preserves headings, lists, markdown
  tables, escaped pipes, and `<br>` line breaks while keeping Devil's Advocate
  anchor highlights clickable and sorted by document order. Verified focused
  analysis display/page tests with bundled Node (`36 passed`) and
  `npm --prefix apps/web run build`. Deployed to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt
  production web, recreated edge, verified public document/analysis routes,
  and reparsed all 3 completed production DOCX documents.
- [x] Render parser-produced HTML formatting in parsed document previews:
  `MarkdownPreview` now recognizes safe parser HTML blocks and inline tags
  (`table`, `p`, `strong`, `u`, `a`, lists) instead of showing raw tags, while
  filtering attributes to safe links only. Verified
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test -- markdownHtmlParser`, full frontend tests
  (`109 passed`), and `npm --prefix apps/web run build`. Synced the changed
  web files to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production web, recreated edge, and
  verified the production bundle contains the HTML renderer plus public
  `/doc-challanger/login`, `/doc-challanger/api/health`, and the affected
  document route.
- [x] Move production domain to HTTPS: public DNS for `iseremenko.ru` and
  `www.iseremenko.ru` now resolves to `178.250.159.250`, certbot issued a
  server-side Let's Encrypt certificate for both names, and production nginx
  now serves `/doc-challanger` over `https://iseremenko.ru` with `www` and HTTP
  canonical redirects. Production Compose exposes `443` and mounts
  `/etc/letsencrypt` for edge TLS termination; API production public URL/CORS
  settings were updated to include the HTTPS origin.
- [x] Fix production login Private Network Access preflight: Chrome sent
  `Access-Control-Request-Private-Network: true` for
  `/doc-challanger/api/auth/login`, and FastAPI CORS returned
  `400 Disallowed CORS private-network`. API CORS now allows private-network
  preflights for configured origins. Verified with
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests/test_health.py -q` (`4 passed`,
  one existing Starlette/httpx deprecation warning). Deployed to
  `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production `api`, recreated `edge`, and verified
  server-local plus edge `/health` and PNA preflight for `/auth/login`. Follow-up
  after Chrome still rejected insecure `http://iseremenko.ru` as local address
  space: nginx now redirects `iseremenko.ru` to the public IP origin
  `http://178.250.159.250`, pending proper public DNS plus HTTPS for the domain.
- [x] Sharpen Gate Challenger `assessment_markdown` tone requirements:
  `gate2_challenger_renderer` now asks both summary and full main-analysis
  prompts for CEO/CPO IC language, a short Brutal Truth-style opening, and
  proven / not proven / cannot approve yet framing while preserving facts,
  verdicts, evidence, required fields, and Layer 1 / Layer 2 contracts.
  Verified with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/worker/tests/test_skill_renderers.py -q`
  (`13 passed`) and `.venv/bin/python -m pytest
  apps/worker/tests/test_run_analysis_job.py -q` (`8 passed`, one existing
  passlib deprecation warning). Pushed commit `232e243` to `main`, synced the
  worker renderer to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production `worker`, and
  verified the new container imports the tone block plus server-local and edge
  `/health`.
- [x] Publish Gate Challenger under `iseremenko.ru/doc-challanger`: added a
  configurable Next.js base path, route helper coverage for imperative
  navigation, production nginx routing for `/doc-challanger` and
  `/doc-challanger/api`, and production Compose build args for
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=/doc-challanger`. Focused route tests, full frontend
  tests (`106 passed`), production frontend build with `/doc-challanger`, and
  production Compose config with dummy env pass locally. Synced the release
  tree to `178.250.159.250`, set production public URLs to
  `/doc-challanger/api` and `http://iseremenko.ru/doc-challanger/api`, rebuilt
  production web, recreated edge, and verified container status, root
  `/doc-challanger/login` redirects, edge `/doc-challanger/login`, edge
  `/doc-challanger/api/health`, and `_next` assets under `/doc-challanger`.
  External IP checks for `http://178.250.159.250/doc-challanger/login` and
  `/doc-challanger/api/health` pass. Public DNS for `iseremenko.ru` still
  returns no A/NS records on 2026-06-23; Selectel DNS setup remains required.
- [x] Fix analysis detail permissions for document-visible analyses: direct
  `GET /analyses/{analysis_id}` now authorizes through the linked active
  document, so a non-admin user who can view the analyzed document can open
  analyses inside it even when the run was created by an admin. Analysis delete
  remains run-owner/admin scoped. Verified the RED regression and relevant API
  suite with `STORAGE_ROOT=/private/tmp/gate-challenger-api-test-storage
  .venv/bin/python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider
  apps/api/tests/test_analyses_api.py apps/api/tests/test_feedback.py
  apps/api/tests/test_documents_upload.py apps/api/tests/test_authz_policies.py
  -q` (`40 passed`) and full API tests (`141 passed`). Synced changed files
  to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production `api`, verified container status,
  server-local `/health` and edge `/api/health`, and confirmed production
  access for analysis `7ee2684b-8e44-44c7-9c4d-15b1e27a479c` with its
  document owner actor.
- [x] Compact analysis launch controls in production: moved model selection,
  output language, and `Start analysis` into a button-like toolbar directly
  under `Analysis history`, removing the standalone `Analysis setup` block from
  the document hero. Verified focused document-detail test, full frontend tests
  (`101 passed`), local production web build, pushed commit `80433ee` to
  `main`, synchronized the release tree to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt
  production web, recreated edge, and verified production container status plus
  server-local `/api/health` and `/login` through nginx edge.
- [x] Rework document detail actions and deploy to production: moved
  `Download raw` / `Reparse` / `Delete` to the document title level and moved
  `Model`, `Output language`, and `Start analysis` into an explicit
  `Analysis setup` block. Verified full frontend tests (`101 passed`), local
  production web build, pushed commit `5fa3b99` to `main`, synchronized the
  release tree to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production web, recreated edge,
  and verified production container status plus server-local `/api/health` and
  `/login` through nginx edge.
- [x] Fix Devil's Advocate JSON parsing for literal control characters:
  production analysis `74e1c7f8-7699-416c-8be0-15b8e4f5aa8a` completed the
  main Gate Challenger run, but the linked DA prepass failed because provider
  `choices[0].message.content` contained literal tab characters inside
  `anchor_text` JSON strings (`Cost allocation, %\t3%\t37%...`). The worker
  JSON validator now retries only `Invalid control character` failures with
  permissive JSON string parsing while preserving schema validation. Verified
  RED/GREEN regression coverage and full worker tests with
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -p no:cacheprovider apps/worker/tests -q`
  (`73 passed`, one existing passlib warning).
- [x] Audit latest production Gate Challenger layer delivery: analysis
  `9feae0ff-ca4c-4256-aa64-a170636b2f05` is a staged Gate 3 summary run with
  `details_status=not_requested`, `7` compact Layer 1 index items, and `17`
  compact Layer 2 index items. Its prompt snapshot included the selected
  `gate-3-rubric.md` and all `80/80` Gate 3 atomic Layer 2 questions, so the
  summary prompt did not lose the rubric at load time. No production
  `analysis_detail_runs` exist yet, so full detailed Layer 1 / Layer 2 output
  has not been exercised in production; the detail schema/prompt and grouped UI
  do not currently enforce or test exact original-rubric question completeness.
- [x] Implement admin feedback dashboard: add exact nullable feedback rating,
  preserve legacy usefulness-only feedback, return filtered admin feedback
  summary, expose Feedback in the admin top navigation, and rebuild
  `/admin/feedback` around improvement signals and run-level feedback details.
  Verified full API tests, targeted API feedback/admin tests, full frontend
  tests, Compose config, diff whitespace, local web/API container rebuild,
  local Alembic upgrade to `202606180001`, API `/health`, and web `/login`.
  Committed `e9a66e2`, fast-forward merged to `main`, pushed to origin, synced
  clean release tree to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production API/worker/web,
  applied production Alembic upgrade to `202606180001`, restarted edge, and
  verified production container status, Alembic current, server-local
  `/api/health`, `/login`, `/admin/feedback`, unauthenticated
  `/api/admin/feedback` auth failure, and fresh service logs.
- [x] Recover Devil's Advocate role comments from truncated provider output:
  production analysis `9feae0ff-ca4c-4256-aa64-a170636b2f05` has a failed
  DA prepass with `structured_output = null`, but the raw provider message
  contains a complete `role_comments` array before the JSON truncation point.
  The analysis page now falls back to parsing that completed array from
  admin-visible raw output, so Document comments and the DA role comments table
  can render even when later JSON fields were cut off.
- [x] Improve failed Devil's Advocate truncation display on analysis pages:
  frontend now maps `Unterminated string starting at...` DA failures to a
  readable provider-truncation message, and admin-visible raw provider output
  can recover `native_markdown` from a truncated JSON string so the Devil's
  Advocate block still renders like other analyses when the markdown field was
  completed before truncation. Verified focused analysis display test, full
  frontend tests, production frontend build, and full worker tests locally.
- [x] Compact Devil's Advocate prepass output for Gate Challenger Layer 4:
  worker-created DA prepass runs now mark
  `devils_advocate_output_contract=compact_prepass`, and the DA renderer uses
  that flag to request a concise JSON contract instead of a full UI report:
  short `native_markdown`, at most 3 contradictions, exactly one role comment
  per voter, 3 tough questions, 3 JTBDs, compact citations, and no Markdown
  role-comments table. Full DA report behavior remains available for runs that
  are not `run_order=before_gate_challenger`. Verified focused RED/GREEN
  coverage and full worker tests with `.venv/bin/python -m pytest
  apps/worker/tests -q` (`72 passed`, one existing passlib warning).
- [x] Diagnose production analysis
  `9feae0ff-ca4c-4256-aa64-a170636b2f05` JSON failure: main Gate
  Challenger run completed successfully, but the linked Devil's Advocate
  prepass `1c289e8d-61cf-4966-b2b6-24f03915fedf` failed parsing provider
  output. OpenRouter/Anthropic returned `finish_reason=length` with exactly
  `completion_tokens=20000`; the assistant content length was `50061`
  characters and ended mid-JSON, producing Python `JSONDecodeError:
  Unterminated string starting at line 1 column 50056`. The document parse was
  completed (`goods-loans-progress-review.docx`, parsed text about 56k
  characters), and the DA prompt artifact was about 157k bytes / 66,952 prompt
  tokens, so the root cause is DA prepass output truncation at the configured
  `max_output_tokens=20000`, not a frontend rendering issue.
- [x] Assemble production timeout repro bundle for analysis
  `6c7ac1d8-83ce-48e1-87c2-2dd676b7415f`: copied saved main Responses API
  prompt, Devil's Advocate prepass Chat Completions prompt, source `Gate_3.pdf`,
  schemas, metadata, and a stdlib Python repro script under ignored
  `repro/admllm-timeout-6c7ac1d8/`, plus
  `repro/admllm-timeout-6c7ac1d8.tar.gz`. Verified prompt/PDF hashes against
  production and dry-ran both request payload builders. Since `analyses` do not
  persist provider `base_url`, recovered the run-time
  `https://admllm.data-light.ru/v1` value from the 2026-06-15 provider-key
  audit log; the key was later replaced with OpenRouter on 2026-06-18.
- [x] Implement Gate2 benchmark etalon flow in branch
  `codex/gate2-etalon-benchmark-layers`: added admin import of Gate2
  originals and Layer 1 / Layer 2 CSV etalons into project
  documents/etalons, source metadata and snapshots, judge v2 prompt seeding,
  layer-only benchmark comparison, v2 micro-average scoring, `.dotx` parsing,
  and frontend API client support. Full API tests, full worker tests, full
  frontend unit tests, production web build, Compose config, and diff hygiene
  checks pass locally; e2e remains not run because `E2E_ADMIN_LOGIN` /
  `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are not set. Merged into `main`, pushed to origin,
  deployed release `cfb7441` to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production
  API/worker/web, applied Alembic upgrade to `202606170002`, reseeded baseline
  skills, recreated edge to refresh Docker upstreams, and verified production
  container status, public `/api/health`, public `/login`, unauthenticated
  Gate2 import returns auth failure instead of not-found, bootstrap admin
  `login` then `/auth/me`, and fresh API/worker/edge logs with no new `502`.
  Follow-up production enablement synced `benchmark/` into the mounted Gate
  Challenger source, cleaned macOS metadata files, reseeded `benchmark_judge`
  to the Gate2 v2 prompt, imported 4 active Gate2 benchmark etalons/originals
  (`genai`, `pws`, `travel`, `trx-se`), fixed `.dotx` template parsing in the
  worker, rebuilt production worker with prod compose env, and verified all 4
  imported originals are parsed successfully.
- [x] Diagnose and restore production auth/API `502 Bad Gateway`: root cause
  was nginx edge holding a stale resolved Docker upstream after the API
  container was rebuilt. Edge still proxied `/api/*` to old API IP
  `172.18.0.5`, while the current API container was `172.18.0.4` and answered
  direct health/auth requests. Restarted `infra-edge-1` on
  `178.250.159.250`; verified edge `/api/health` returns `200`, unauthenticated
  auth probes return normal `401`, and bootstrap admin `login` then `/auth/me`
  returns `200`. Follow-up: restart edge after API/web container replacement or
  change nginx config to runtime-resolve Docker service names.
- [x] Start structured document parse artifacts on branch
  `codex/structured-parse-artifacts`: worker parsers now keep the existing
  `parsed_text` string contract while also producing a `document_parse_artifact.v1`
  JSON contract with source metadata, parser metadata, markdown/plain outputs,
  block spans, and quality diagnostics. Parse jobs persist `parsed.txt`,
  `parsed.md`, `structured.json`, and `quality.json` under the existing parsed
  artifact directory, and audit metadata records parser/quality summary
  without storage paths. Added lightweight `docling-slim` as the preferred
  `.docx`/`.pdf` worker adapter when installed, with fallback to the current
  python-docx/pypdf adapters when unavailable or conversion fails; the full
  `docling` package was avoided because it pulls Torch/CUDA into the production
  worker image. Verified focused
  parser/parse-job/schema tests, full worker tests, and full API tests. Merged
  into `main`, pushed to origin, deployed to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt
  production API/worker with `docling-slim`, verified production container
  status, API `/health`, `/login`, worker startup logs, and confirmed
  `docling.document_converter` is importable inside the production worker.
- [x] Fix document-detail low-resolution analysis history action clipping:
  root cause was the two-column document detail grid letting the Analysis
  history panel become narrower than its 560px table at compact desktop widths,
  pushing the `Open` action into horizontal overflow. Added a 1440px responsive
  rule that shrinks `Parsed document` first and preserves a 600px history
  column before the existing single-column breakpoint. Verified focused
  responsive test, full frontend tests, production web build, local web/API
  container rebuild, and local `/login` plus `/health` smoke.
- [x] Add analysis deletion: implemented soft-delete for analysis runs via
  `deleted_at`, `DELETE /analyses/{analysis_id}` with owner/admin access,
  hidden deleted runs from user/admin analysis reads and lists, blocked
  feedback on deleted analyses, and added a guarded Delete action on the
  analysis result page that returns to the source document. Verified full API
  tests, full worker tests, full frontend unit tests, production web build,
  Compose config, local web/API container rebuild, Alembic upgrade to
  `202606170001`, local container status, API `/health`, and web `/login`.
  Merged into `main`, deployed to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production
  API/worker/web, applied production Alembic upgrade to `202606170001`,
  verified production container status, public `/api/health`, public `/login`,
  public unauthenticated `DELETE /api/analyses/{id}` returns auth failure
  instead of method-not-allowed, and checked fresh API/web/worker logs.
- [x] Fix production document-detail workflow card height mismatch: root cause
  is the document-detail stepper using flex cross-axis centering, so shorter
  status cards such as `Ready` keep their content-height while neighboring
  cards wrap to two text lines. Changed `.gc-stepper` to stretch items per
  flex row and added responsive UI coverage. Focused responsive test, full
  frontend test suite, and production web build pass locally. Deployed to
  `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production web, verified container status,
  `/api/health`, `/login`, the document route, and confirmed the built
  `/documents/[documentId]` bundle contains `align-items: stretch`.
- [x] Add editing for saved provider key Model and Allowlist in Settings:
  implemented local `PATCH /settings/provider-keys/{provider}` to update
  `default_model` and `available_models` without replacing encrypted key
  material, added inline edit/save/cancel controls in the saved keys table, and
  verified API/frontend tests plus production frontend build locally. Deployed
  to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production API/web, and verified container
  status, edge `/api/health`, direct `/settings`, and unauthenticated
  `PATCH /settings/provider-keys/openai_compatible` returns auth failure
  instead of method-not-allowed.
- [x] Reduce Devil's Advocate prompt size without dropping retrieval evidence:
  renderer no longer sends the expanded retrieval `evidence_packet` twice.
  The retrieval dossier block now contains compact selection/trace metadata and
  marks the full packet as included in the separate expanded evidence section,
  while selected item excerpts and full retrieved evidence remain available to
  the model. Verified focused DA renderer/job tests and the full worker test
  suite. Deployed to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production worker, verified
  container status, API health, `/login`, worker logs, and confirmed the
  production worker imports the compact retrieval helper.
- [x] Implement resilient Document comments anchoring: frontend anchor matching
  now falls back from exact/case-insensitive search to whitespace-normalized,
  punctuation-normalized, and high-confidence token-window matching while
  preserving original parsed-text spans. Devil's Advocate prompt/schema now
  require short source quotes copied from parsed document text instead of
  paraphrased/broad anchor summaries. Verified focused analysis display tests,
  full frontend tests, production frontend build, full API tests, full worker
  tests, local web container rebuild, Compose container status, API health, and
  web `/login` smoke. Read-only projection against the production DOM for
  analysis `6946539f-53a3-4605-b05c-2822fbd427dd` matched all 4 existing
  comments: 1 whitespace-normalized match and 3 token-window matches. Deployed
  to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production API/worker/web, verified public
  `/api/health`, public `/login`, production container status, and confirmed
  the analysis UI now renders 4 anchor groups, 4 matched comment cards, and 0
  unmatched cards.
- [x] Diagnose production analysis `6946539f-53a3-4605-b05c-2822fbd427dd`
  Document comments anchoring: the page has 4 Devil's Advocate role comments
  and parsed text loads correctly, but 0 document anchor spans render because
  all 4 `anchor_text` values fail the current exact/case-insensitive frontend
  match. One anchor would match after whitespace/punctuation normalization;
  the others only partially overlap the parsed text, so they remain visible as
  unlinked comment cards.
- [x] Reduce Gate Challenger main prompt size for known stage documents without
  dropping reproducibility: source snapshots still persist the full
  Gate-challenger reference set, but the worker renderer now sends only common
  references plus the matching stage rubric to the model. For `gate_2` runs
  this removes the Gate 3 and Stream Review rubrics from the model input while
  retaining Gate 2, verdict, synthesis, adversarial, output-contract, and
  stage-detection rules. Verified with focused renderer coverage and the full
  worker test suite.
- [x] Record and verify infrastructure access note: root SSH to
  `178.250.159.250` works with explicit identity `~/.ssh/my-server-codex`
  (codex key) and returns `root`; the default identities are rejected for that
  host. Root SSH to `avi-ix-devbox04` with the same key was rejected
  (`publickey`). Private key material must not be stored or committed.
- [x] Render an explicit blank paragraph after the Gate Challenger verdict line:
  production data already contains a blank line after `Recommendation`, but the
  markdown renderer intentionally skipped blank lines. The renderer now inserts
  an `aria-hidden` spacer paragraph after standalone recommendation verdicts,
  so the separation is structural instead of relying on collapsed markdown
  whitespace. Local focused markdown tests, full frontend tests, and production
  build pass. Deployed to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt production web, verified
  health/container status, and confirmed the built production bundle contains
  `gc-md-paragraph-spacer` with `height: 1.62em`.
- [x] Increase visible spacing after the Gate Challenger verdict line: the
  previous paragraph split reached production but still looked nearly identical
  because the default paragraph margin was too small. Standalone
  `Recommendation:` verdict paragraphs now receive a dedicated lead-label
  class with a larger bottom margin. Local focused markdown tests, full
  frontend tests, and production build pass. Deployed to `178.250.159.250`,
  rebuilt production web, verified health/login/container status, and confirmed
  the built production bundle contains `gc-md-paragraph--lead-label` with
  `margin-bottom: 28px`.
- [x] Add visual separation between Gate Challenger verdict and following
  narrative text: markdown paragraph parsing now treats section-label lines
  such as `Decision Context:` as a new paragraph instead of joining them into
  the previous verdict line. Local focused markdown tests, full frontend tests,
  and production build pass. Deployed the updated web to `178.250.159.250` and
  verified server-side API health, `/login`, and container status. Local web
  container rebuild remains blocked because the Docker daemon is not running
  after the earlier Colima image checksum mismatch.
- [x] Fix Gate Challenger markdown display bug where a bold standalone section
  label after a loose ordered list was rendered as part of the previous list,
  causing the following improvement items to keep numbering as 6/7/... instead
  of restarting visually. Added parser coverage for the Gate output shape and
  verified the focused parser test, full frontend unit suite, and production
  frontend build locally. Deployed the code to `178.250.159.250`, rebuilt
  production web/API/worker containers, and verified server-side API health,
  `/login`, and container status. Local web container rebuild is blocked by a
  Colima image checksum mismatch while starting Docker.
- [x] Diagnose production analysis `7142b87b-76a5-499e-b76c-463ff94bfbb6`
  failure: main worker job failed before provider call while creating the
  Devil's Advocate source snapshot because `/external/devils-advocate` had
  the source files nested under an absolute local path instead of at the
  configured source root. Re-synchronized the required DA files/directories to
  the production source root and verified the production container can now
  collect a 96-file DA manifest in `production_export` mode.
- [x] Fix production `git command failed: rev-parse HEAD` for exported skill
  source directories: added configurable `SKILL_SOURCE_SNAPSHOT_MODE`, set
  prod compose default to `production_export`, and verified API snapshots can
  persist manifest/fingerprint artifacts from read-only source exports without
  git metadata while strict `production_latest` remains available.
- [x] Deploy production MVP to new server `178.250.159.250`: installed Docker,
  Compose, Git, and rsync; synchronized the current working tree plus clean
  git snapshot copies of the Gate Challenger and Devil's Advocate skill
  sources; created server-local production `.env` and bootstrap admin
  credentials under `/root/gate-challenger-admin.txt`; rebuilt and started
  postgres, redis, api, worker, web, and nginx edge on host port 80; applied
  Alembic migrations, seeded 5 baseline skills, created admin user `admin`,
  and verified public `http://178.250.159.250/api/health`,
  `http://178.250.159.250/login`, admin login/me, and container status.
- [x] Move production entrypoint off port 80 on `avi-ix-devbox04`: production
  compose now defaults nginx edge to host port `8092` and binds direct API/web
  published ports to `127.0.0.1`, so the shared devbox main address is no
  longer occupied by this project. Deployed release
  `20260615-000224-port8092-e7d3cb6`, rebuilt web with
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://avi-ix-devbox04:8092/api`, verified
  server-side `/api/health`, `/login`, CORS for `http://avi-ix-devbox04:8092`,
  admin auth, and skill listing through port `8092`; direct Codex sandbox HTTP
  access to devbox still times out due the external network path.
- [x] Fix responsive UI artifacts across the main web screens: analysis tabs
  now wrap instead of clipping `Full Output`, route-local buttons/links/inputs
  keep 44px touch targets, document filter tabs wrap on compact widths, the
  analysis feedback action leaves bottom breathing room, and checkbox labels
  have a 44px tap target. Follow-up desktop audit fixed document-detail
  workflow metadata clipping and parsed Markdown table cell clipping at
  1366px/1024px. Also synchronized the web e2e mock/scenario with the current
  Devil's Advocate contract and analysis feedback flow. Verified with focused
  responsive tests, full frontend tests, production build, e2e MVP flow, local
  web container rebuild, and localhost browser audits at mobile, 1024px, and
  1366px across documents, analysis, etalons, benchmarks, settings, and admin
  routes.
- [x] Deploy production MVP to `avi-ix-devbox04`: added production compose,
  production Next.js Dockerfile, configurable CORS origins, external skill
  source mounts, and nginx edge proxy for `http://avi-ix-devbox04/api` plus
  Next.js web at `http://avi-ix-devbox04`; local API/worker/frontend tests and
  builds passed, prod Alembic upgrade/admin bootstrap/skill seeding completed,
  server-side edge/API/web/worker smoke passed, and a test document upload was
  parsed and deleted successfully. Direct HTTP from the Codex sandbox to
  `avi-ix-devbox04` timed out even though the server listens on 80/3000/8000
  and answers on all local interfaces, so any remaining access issue is outside
  the app/container layer.
- [x] Restrict Etalons and Benchmarks top navigation to admins: shared app
  navigation now hides `/etalons` and `/benchmarks` for `user` and
  `annotator` roles while keeping them visible for `admin`. Verified with the
  focused app navigation test, full frontend tests, production build, and local
  web container rebuild.
- [x] Tighten Devil's Advocate comment output after TRX_SE regression: service
  prompt now treats real names as a pre-flight anomaly to anonymize with
  fictional neutral placeholders instead of stopping, requires the visible
  Role comments section to be a Markdown table with role/vote/decision/anchor
  quote/comment/type/severity columns, and the DA JSON schema rejects
  completed `role_comments` with empty `comments` arrays. Verified with full
  API and worker test suites, rebuilt local API/worker containers, and checked
  API `/health`.
- [x] Diagnose latest Devil's Advocate comment-format regression on TRX_SE:
  old good run `2f855fc5-e8cf-49e1-b8b2-d00789f91520` used
  `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6`, produced pipe-table role comments plus 20
  structured `role_comments[].comments[]`; latest `openai/gpt-5.5` runs
  `4510f287-3163-4231-ada9-5bc47e04be54` /
  `35a0f9e6-d2b3-4365-956c-33e6ada43137` used the same DA source and
  retrieval fingerprints but stopped at pre-flight on non-anonymized names,
  persisted 0 structured role comments, and therefore had no table-shaped data
  for the UI to render.
- [x] Compare latest staged TRX_SE run with older legacy TRX_SE runs:
  latest `b6ce453c-bf8a-4aae-86a5-07d855eea0a4` completed with summary-only
  Gate Challenger plus completed detail run
  `030bcdd0-085f-4d8d-9af6-66ea14ef5aa9`; quality/coverage improved
  materially with 8 Layer 1 and 12 structured Layer 2 checks, while total
  on-demand detail cost/latency is higher than old Gemini legacy full runs.
- [x] Fix Layer 2 detailed-check card spacing/wrapping: long Layer 2 questions
  now wrap inside the card instead of stretching the row, and compact
  Issue/Evidence fields have horizontal inset padding so text no longer starts
  flush against the card edge. Verified with frontend tests and production
  build, web/API container rebuild, Docker status, and localhost browser smoke.
- [x] Fix lazy detail Layer 1 / Layer 2 UI merging when detail markdown uses
  shorthand bullets such as `- L1-1: ...` and `- L2-1: ...`: the parser now
  extracts those IDs, merges markdown sections with structured JSON by ID,
  keeps structured Layer 2 questions authoritative for shorthand detail
  records, and avoids duplicate empty synthetic Layer 1 cards. Verified with
  frontend tests, production build, web/API container rebuild, Docker status,
  and localhost browser smoke.
- [x] Implement staged Gate Challenger lazy details: new analyses can persist a
  Responses API summary contract with `gate_challenger_response_id`, lazy
  `analysis_detail_runs` load full Layer 1 / Layer 2 via
  `previous_response_id`, API exposes `POST/GET /analyses/{id}/details`, and
  Full Output can request/poll/render completed or failed detail runs while
  legacy full analyses keep rendering. Verified with full API tests, full
  worker tests, full frontend unit tests, production build, Compose config,
  Docker rebuild/restart for API/worker/web, Alembic upgrade to
  `202606140002`, and localhost browser smoke; e2e did not start because
  `E2E_ADMIN_LOGIN` / `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` were not set.
- [x] Add document-title editing from the document detail pencil action:
  `PATCH /documents/{id}/title` now trims and validates titles with ownership
  checks and audit logging, the frontend API exposes `patchDocumentTitle`, and
  the detail page switches the title row into an inline editor with Save,
  Cancel, and Escape-to-cancel behavior. Verified with
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest apps/api/tests -q`, focused
  document-detail/API frontend tests, `npm --prefix apps/web run build`, Compose
  config, web container rebuild, and localhost browser smoke; full frontend
  unit suite still fails on unrelated in-progress lazy-details tests in
  `apps/web/src/app/analyses/[analysisId]/*`.
- [x] Save staged Gate Challenger lazy-details technical specification in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-14-staged-gate-challenger-lazy-details.md`.
- [x] Add and run isolated `prototypes/admllm-session-probe` for admllm
  Responses API: `/v1/responses` works with `previous_response_id` on
  `openai/gpt-5.5`, follow-up remembered the synthetic marker without
  resending it, `background=true` and `/responses/compact` were accepted,
  while `/responses/{id}/input_items` returned `model=None` 400 even after a
  retry with `model=openai/gpt-5.5`.
- [x] Diagnose analysis `36a2b89c-7f19-4acc-9666-bea9bcc9aee6`
  timeout: Devil's Advocate prepass completed in 44s, then the main Gate
  Challenger `openai_compatible` / `openai/gpt-5.5` call through
  `https://admllm.data-light.ru/v1` failed after roughly 3 minutes with
  upstream `InternalServerError` request-id
  `25aa1f00-adf2-42ff-a79d-94d1bd500269`; failed call returned no usage, but
  the saved main prompt is 286,847 chars / 289,036 bytes, with an estimated
  61.5k input tokens based on successful same-document Gate Challenger runs;
  the preceding Devil's Advocate prepass completed in 44.154s with 58,304 input
  tokens and 3,790 output tokens.
- [x] Add an in-page waiting loader and automatic polling to the Gate
  Challenger analysis result page while the main or Devil's Advocate run is
  `queued` / `running`; polling stops on terminal statuses. Verified with the
  focused analysis page test, full frontend tests, production build, Compose
  config, web container rebuild, and localhost browser smoke.
- [x] Fix the document-detail `Model` button display by replacing the
  concatenated text chevron with a dedicated CSS chevron and trigger spacing,
  and simplify the model popover to only output language, model selection, and
  save; verified with frontend tests, production build, web container rebuild,
  and a localhost browser check.
- [x] Move analysis-page `Detailed checks` and the full Devil's Advocate
  display into `Full Output`, leaving the main Gate Challenger tab focused on
  summary/narrative output and removing the standalone Devil's Advocate tab;
  verified with analysis page tests, full frontend tests, production build,
  web container rebuild, and localhost browser smoke.
- [x] Fix `short summary` display on the analysis page so summary text uses
  the full card width instead of the old 92-character measure; verified with
  the analysis page frontend test, production build, and web container
  rebuild.
- [x] Move analysis-page feedback collection to variant 2: a floating
  bottom-right action opens a compact feedback sheet instead of reserving a
  right-side card beside the analysis content. Verified with the analysis page
  frontend test, production build, and web container rebuild.
- [x] Remove the `Etalon draft` card and create-draft action from the
  analysis result page for now; verified with the analysis page frontend test
  production build, and web container rebuild.
- [x] Add the analysis result `Document comments` tab between Gate Challenger
  and Devil's Advocate: Devil's Advocate `role_comments` now map onto parsed
  document anchors, render Google Docs-style role comment cards with vote-based
  avatar rings, and support bidirectional anchor/card highlighting. Verified
  with focused frontend tests, production build, and web container rebuild;
  localhost analysis browser check reached the login screen without local
  credentials.
- [x] Restrict model selection to admin-managed shared provider settings:
  admin provider keys now carry a model allowlist seeded with
  `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7`, `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`,
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, `google/gemini-3.5-flash`, `openai/gpt-5.5`,
  and `qwen/qwen3.5-397b-a17b`; non-admin analysis and benchmark launches use
  the shared admin key and select from the allowlist instead of free model
  input. Verified with API/worker/frontend tests, production build, Alembic
  upgrade on local Postgres, and rebuilt local API/web/worker containers.
- [x] Realign Gate Challenger Layer 1 / Layer 2 display with the original
  skill output contract for analysis `8a4f393b-e2b3-4947-9fca-b247ed2dfbb1`:
  Layer 1 renders `issue` / `evidence` / `severity`, Layer 2 renders
  `question` / `answer` / `evidence` / `issue`, and non-skill Layer 2 fields
  such as `Risk`, `Recommendation`, and `Reference` are not shown; verified
  with full API, worker, and web tests, production build, web container
  rebuild, and localhost browser checks.
- [x] Redesign the analysis result Layer 1 / Layer 2 display: the Gate
  Challenger tab now shows a full collapsed Layer 1 checklist by canonical
  block name and verdict, includes PASS/no-material markdown-only sections,
  nests linked Layer 2 checks, and exposes Layer 2 question answers/evidence;
  verified with frontend tests, production build, web container rebuild, and a
  localhost browser check on analysis `8a4f393b-e2b3-4947-9fca-b247ed2dfbb1`.
- [x] Add a structured Devil's Advocate to Gate Challenger Layer 4 synthesis:
  completed DA prepass results now produce ranked must-review signals,
  role consensus, decision metadata, and open IC questions, and the Gate prompt
  tells the model not to silently drop critical/high/important DA signals.
- [x] Remove the Gate Challenger section subtitle from the analysis result page
  so `skill · provider · model` stays only in Run details; verified with the
  analysis frontend test slice, production build, and web container rebuild.
- [x] Diagnose current Layer 1 / Layer 2 glue for analysis
  `8a4f393b-e2b3-4947-9fca-b247ed2dfbb1`: the main Gate Challenger view
  renders 6 structured Layer 1 groups and 5 structured Layer 2 checks, while
  the saved markdown also contains a `Problem framing and segments: PASS`
  / `No material issue` Layer 1 section plus its Layer 2 `answer: YES`
  question; those PASS-only markdown sections are visible only in Full Output.
- [x] Finish the Paper Document detail page cleanup: replace the remaining
  dark-detail shell with the `Editable / Document detail` light layout,
  top-level document actions, compact model popover, workflow cards, parsed
  markdown panel, and tabular analysis history; verified with the Documents
  frontend test slice and production build.
- [x] Implement the Paper feedback card on the analysis result page: replace
  the old usefulness select/benchmark checkbox with a 5-point icon rating,
  optional comment textarea with a 1000-character counter, and full-width
  submit action while preserving the existing feedback API usefulness contract.
- [x] Add structured Layer 1 / Layer 2 rendering on the analysis result page:
  Layer 2 questions now group under their parent Layer 1 item and show the
  contract `status` as `PASS` / `PARTIAL` / `FAIL`, with the Gate Challenger
  output schema and prompt updated so future runs return `layer_2.status`.
- [x] Diagnose analysis `23998695-0529-44b0-9b04-f1a50e898e2d` failure:
  both Devil's Advocate prepass and Gate Challenger main run used
  `openai_compatible` / `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` and timed out upstream
  after roughly three minutes per provider request; the page can appear
  `running` until refreshed because the analysis detail UI fetches once and
  does not poll running runs.
- [x] Fix Devil's Advocate prepass failures when OpenAI-compatible Gemini
  returns only `run_mode` plus rich `native_markdown`: worker validation now
  normalizes that markdown into the required structured contract while
  preserving raw provider output; verified with worker/API tests.
- [x] Diagnose degraded Gate Challenger output for analysis
  `f0d07e82-8bfd-49fe-98b2-f6a185146978`: the run used
  `openai_compatible` / `gemini-3.5-flash`, the Devil's Advocate prepass failed
  schema validation after returning only `run_mode` and `native_markdown`, Gate
  Challenger therefore ran without `gate_challenger_layer_4_context`, and the
  document has `detected_document_type=gate_3` but
  `manual_document_type=gate_2`, causing run metadata and rendered prompts to
  disagree about the stage.
- [x] Diagnose Devil's Advocate table rendering discrepancy: the older
  `anthropic/claude-opus-4.6` run returned pipe-table Markdown plus
  `anchored_comments`, while the newer `gemini-3.5-flash` RU prepass returned
  prose sections without pipe tables or anchored comments, so the UI had no
  table-shaped Markdown to render.
- [x] Lock Devil's Advocate role-comment output to the original skill contract:
  `role_comments[].comments[]` now uses `anchor_text`, `body`,
  `comment_type`, and `severity`, with schema, worker prompt, UI extraction,
  and tests aligned to that shape.
- [x] Create root `AGENTS.md` with project, workflow, security, and
  repository-local context instructions.
- [x] Create root `TASKS.md` aligned with the MVP phase plan.
- [x] Finish full Phase 1 Docker Compose runtime verification using verified
  public mirror image defaults.
- [x] Verify frontend package install, tests, production build, and critical
  npm audit threshold.
- [x] Verify Phase 1 API login/admin/ownership smoke and Alembic
  upgrade/downgrade in a local backend venv.
- [x] Implement Phase 2 backend document upload slice: supported file upload,
  local raw storage, queued document rows, and user/admin ownership visibility.
- [x] Implement Phase 2 backend parser/job slice: `.txt`, `.md`, `.docx`, and
  `.pdf` parsers, parsed artifact storage, deterministic type detection, parse
  status updates, and upload enqueue wiring.
- [x] Implement document detail API/UI slice plus Phase 3 main-analysis MVP:
  parsed/raw/reparse endpoints, manual type override, provider key settings,
  skill list, analysis launch/detail, worker main-analysis job, provider
  adapters, and feedback capture.
- [x] Complete Phase 3 second-stage runtime: Gate2/Devil's Advocate prompt
  renderers, Devil's Advocate predicted-comments worker job, reproducible
  second-stage run metadata, API detail embedding, and result UI block.
- [x] Close Phase 3 skill admin/runtime hardening: admin skill create, archive,
  patch, source refresh, schema/source validation, provider key test endpoint,
  and worker skill-source availability checks.
- [x] Implement Phase 4 backend etalon foundation: Layer 1/Layer 2 payload
  validation, draft creation from completed analyses, ownership checks, and
  admin/annotator active-status guard.
- [x] Implement Phase 4 backend etalon review lifecycle: list/detail,
  draft editing, annotation queue, publish, and archive endpoints.
- [x] Complete Phase 4 remaining MVP: past-defense import, benchmark API,
  benchmark worker scoring/reporting, and etalon/benchmark UI pages.
- [x] Add deletion workflows for documents, admin-only users, and admin-only
  etalons using reproducibility-preserving soft-delete status.
- [x] Implement external Gate Challenger and Devil's Advocate runtime snapshots:
  source registry, immutable source artifacts, DA deterministic retrieval
  dossier, snapshot-aware worker renderers, prompt fingerprints, and API/UI
  source/retrieval trace summaries.
- [x] Lock native output contracts for TRX-SE-style runs: Gate Challenger
  renders assessment summary followed by strict Layer 1 and Layer 2, and
  Devil's Advocate renders native `ic-voting-prompt.md` IC voting output before
  structured JSON details.
- [x] Improve document detail Analysis form so it defaults to the saved provider
  model from settings while still allowing a per-run model override; verified
  with frontend tests and production build.
- [x] Redesign the MVP web interface into a dark enterprise review console
  across documents, upload, analysis, benchmarks, etalons, annotation,
  settings, and admin pages while preserving existing API actions; verified
  with frontend/API tests, production build, code-review pass, login browser
  smoke, and the full Playwright MVP flow.
- [x] Fix responsive layout regressions in the dark redesign: app content no
  longer overflows beside the sidebar, phone navigation fits without horizontal
  scrolling, and the documents table switches to card rows on tablet/phone
  widths.
- [x] Fix document queue table compression at medium desktop widths: the side
  activity panels now stack below the table before the type/readiness columns
  become too narrow, and short type badges such as `GATE 2` stay on one line.
- [x] Simplify the dark redesign navigation and documents workspace: remove
  redundant environment/admin chips and duplicate document side panels, move
  primary navigation from the left sidebar to a top header, fold user/logout
  controls into that header, and widen the document detail workspace for dense
  review screens.
- [x] Consolidate document upload into the main Documents page and remove the
  redundant `/documents/upload` route and navigation item.
- [x] Fix document detail overflow by narrowing the launch-analysis column and
  rendering analysis history as compact rows inside the panel instead of a wide
  table that pushes the page past the viewport.
- [x] Simplify document detail controls: remove duplicate header actions and
  manual document type editing, keep document actions in one panel, and make
  analysis launch use a saved provider key with an editable model.
- [x] Remove low-value parsed-text helpers from document detail so the parsed
  text panel shows the document content directly without search controls or
  section chips.
- [x] Merge document actions and analysis launch controls into one compact
  document-detail button block, moving provider/model selection into a small
  modal opened from the Model button.
- [x] Render parsed document text and native analysis outputs as Markdown,
  including headings, emphasis, lists, code blocks, and scroll-safe tables
  without adding a frontend dependency.
- [x] Remove the internal vertical scroll from the document Parsed text panel
  so the full parsed markdown content expands on the page.
- [x] Replace the low-value Latest callout in document Analysis history with
  Model and Start new analysis actions, keeping file actions separate.
- [x] Shorten failed analysis messages in document history cards by showing a
  compact provider error summary while keeping the raw error in hover details.
- [x] Simplify the analysis result page: remove the Evidence Workbench eyebrow
  and duplicate hero summary, move provider/model/skill and run metrics into a
  Run details modal with trace data, and remove the duplicate side trace card.
- [x] Switch analysis result display to skill-level markdown passthrough: show
  Gate Challenger and Devil's Advocate outputs as the model-facing markdown
  fields first, with structured JSON kept only in Full Output for diagnostics.
- [x] Keep Gate Challenger main analysis text separate from detailed checks:
  Layer 1 and Layer 2 markdown now render below it under a collapsed
  `Детализированные проверки` section.
- [x] Remove duplicate verdict display from the analysis result sidebar so the
  verdict appears only once in the page header.
- [x] Compact the document detail workflow status into the right side of the
  title row and move raw download, reparse, and delete actions into the parsed
  document panel; verified desktop and 390px mobile layout with no horizontal
  overflow.
- [x] Fix Markdown table rendering for Devil's Advocate outputs: typed table
  columns now keep readable widths and scroll horizontally inside the markdown
  block instead of squeezing `TYPE` and `SEVERITY` into vertical text.
- [x] Fix Markdown loose ordered lists in Gate Challenger outputs: numbered
  sections with paragraphs and nested bullets now stay in one ordered list
  instead of restarting every item at `1`.
- [x] Add the analyzed document title to the Analysis page header and render
  the run date as plain muted text below the title instead of a `Created` chip.
- [x] Add a document analysis RU/EN output-language toggle that stores the
  choice in `run_parameters` and injects the matching language requirement into
  Gate Challenger and Devil's Advocate prompts.
- [x] Reorder analysis execution so Devil's Advocate runs before Gate
  Challenger, persists as the traceable predicted-comment run, and passes its
  Brutal Truth plus Detected Contradictions & Missing Proofs into the Gate
  prompt as Layer 4 expert context.
- [x] Restore the Gate Challenger analysis `short summary` block at the top of
  the result view and remove the duplicated `Оценка документа` heading from
  the lower narrative markdown block.
- [x] Reduce oversized markdown headings in analysis outputs by keeping
  markdown heading styles isolated from page-level analysis title styles.
- [x] Tighten Gate Challenger Layer 1 output contract so Layer 1 items expose
  only `issue`, `evidence`, and `severity` instead of the older expanded
  `title` / `impact` / `recommendation` shape.
- [x] Split Devil's Advocate result markdown into three reader-facing sections:
  pre-role critique, Role comments / voter synthesis, and Actionable JTBDs;
  verified with frontend tests, production build, and web container rebuild.
- [x] Upgrade Devil's Advocate retrieval from excerpt-only dossier to expanded
  evidence packets: selected wiki cases, patterns, heuristics, personas, and
  matching raw comments/minutes are snapshotted into `evidence_packet.md` and
  injected into the DA prompt; DB-imported past-defense etalons remain out of
  provider prompts until a dedicated access/privacy policy is added.
- [x] Finish the Paper Documents screen cleanup: remove the old dark-style
  override stack, align upload/search/table layout with `Editable / Documents`,
  add compact file markers and parse labels, and verify with frontend tests,
  production build, web container rebuild, and localhost browser layout smoke;
  full e2e is blocked locally until `E2E_ADMIN_LOGIN` and
  `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set.
- [x] Tighten the Documents `Document type` control to match Paper: use a
  `Select document type` placeholder, title-case option/table labels, and a
  custom select chevron instead of the raw native select look.

## Decision Log

- 2026-06-07: Added root agent and task workflow documents.
- 2026-06-07: Implemented Phase 1 scaffold, initial schema migration, RBAC
  ownership helpers, cookie session auth, admin user management, bootstrap admin
  seed, baseline skill seed helper, and minimal Next.js authenticated routes.
  Runtime verification is blocked by DNS failures to PyPI, GitHub release
  assets, and npm package installation; Docker daemon setup also depends on
  Colima image download.
- 2026-06-08: Implemented external skill runtime reproducibility. Gate
  Challenger and Devil's Advocate external sources are configured as
  `skill_sources`, snapshotted per run into local artifacts, rendered by workers
  from immutable snapshots, and exposed through API/UI trace summaries. Devil's
  Advocate now builds deterministic lexical retrieval dossiers from the
  snapshotted `wiki-ic` corpus before predicted-comments enqueue.
- 2026-06-07: Frontend dependencies installed using project-local npm cache.
  `npm --prefix apps/web run test`, `npm --prefix apps/web run build`, and
  `npm --prefix apps/web audit --audit-level=critical` pass after updating
  Vitest to 4.1.8. Two moderate Next/PostCSS advisories remain with only a
  breaking `npm audit fix --force` path reported by npm audit.
- 2026-06-07: Reconfirmed backend runtime blockers. `curl` resolves
  `registry.npmjs.org`, but resolving `files.pythonhosted.org` and
  `release-assets.githubusercontent.com` times out; `pip` and `uv pip` cannot
  install backend dependencies, and Colima cannot download its VM image.
- 2026-06-07: Built a local `.venv-backend` using system-site packages,
  cached FastAPI/Starlette, and GitHub source installs for SQLAlchemy, Mako,
  and Alembic. Verified backend imports, password hashing fallback, Alembic
  `upgrade head` and `downgrade base` against SQLite, and a FastAPI TestClient
  smoke covering `/health`, admin login, `/auth/me`, admin user creation/list,
  non-admin 403, blocked user login denial, ownership policies, and worker
  health job. Docker daemon remains unavailable, so full Compose stack with
  PostgreSQL/Redis is still not verified.
- 2026-06-07: Retried Docker Desktop after the daemon became available.
  `docker ps` succeeds and Compose config renders. Full Compose startup remains
  blocked by external DNS failures to Docker Hub (`registry-1.docker.io`) for
  `postgres:16-alpine`/`redis:7-alpine`. Cached-image fallbacks were checked:
  Supabase PostgreSQL and Studio/Node images are present, but no Redis image is
  available, and the cached Python image lacks `pydantic-settings`, `psycopg`,
  `redis`, `rq`, and `passlib`. Installing those or Redis from PyPI/Alpine is
  also blocked by DNS failures to `files.pythonhosted.org` and Alpine package
  repositories.
- 2026-06-07: Found a working registry path through `mirror.gcr.io` for official
  PostgreSQL, Redis, Python, and Node images. Updated Compose defaults and
  `.env.example` to use that public mirror while preserving env overrides.
  Regenerated the web `package-lock.json` in a Linux Node container so Docker
  `npm ci` includes Linux optional dependency entries. Verified full Compose
  stack startup, PostgreSQL Alembic `upgrade head`, bootstrap admin seed, API
  `/health`, admin login with HTTP-only cookie, `/auth/me`, admin user create
  and list, non-admin `403` on admin users, blocked-user login denial,
  ownership policy assertions inside the API image, RQ worker health job
  execution through Redis, and web `/login` plus `/health` routes on port 3000.
- 2026-06-07: Browser-level login smoke found a loopback host mismatch:
  opening the web app at `127.0.0.1:3000` while the API client targeted
  `localhost:8000` caused failed browser auth. Added a CORS regression for both
  `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`, allowed both frontend origins in the API, and made
  the web API client align local API hostname with the current browser hostname.
  Verified browser login reaches `/documents` and the admin users UI creates and
  lists a user.
- 2026-06-07: Completed the document detail and main-analysis MVP slice. The API
  exposes parsed text, raw download, manual document type override, reparse,
  provider key settings, skills, analyses, and feedback. The worker now has
  OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, Hermes, and mock provider adapters,
  validates structured output against shared schemas, and persists raw output,
  token/cost metadata, verdict, summary, status, and errors. Predicted-comments
  and specialized Gate2/Devil's Advocate renderers remain open Phase 3 work.
- 2026-06-07: Closed the Phase 3 second-stage runtime slice. Added
  Gate2-challenger and Devil's Advocate prompt renderers, `run_predicted_comments`
  worker job, second-stage reproducibility metadata on `predicted_comment_runs`,
  automatic enqueue after successful main analysis, enqueue-failure handling that
  preserves the completed main analysis, API embedding of the latest predicted
  comment run, and a Devil's Advocate result UI block.
- 2026-06-08: Closed the remaining Phase 3 skill/provider gaps. Added admin
  skill create, patch, archive, and source-refresh endpoints; result schema and
  local source validation; deterministic source fingerprint refresh; provider
  key configuration test endpoint without plaintext key exposure; provider-key
  and skill audit events; and worker failures for unavailable or changed
  external skill sources before provider calls.
- 2026-06-08: Started Phase 4 with the backend etalon foundation. Added
  Pydantic validation for expected verdict, Layer 1, Layer 2, evidence, and
  Layer 2 parent links; added `POST /analyses/{analysis_id}/etalon-draft`;
  draft creation now enforces analysis ownership, completed-analysis
  precondition, source `ai_post_annotation`, and admin/annotator-only active
  status.
- 2026-06-08: Added the backend etalon review lifecycle. Authenticated users can
  list active etalons and their own drafts; admin/annotator can review drafts
  through the annotation queue, edit non-archived etalons, publish drafts to
  active, and archive etalons. Draft authors can edit their own drafts, but
  normal users cannot edit active etalons or publish/archive lifecycle state.
- 2026-06-08: Completed Phase 4 MVP. Added past-defense import with raw document
  storage, parse enqueue, and imported etalon drafts; benchmark API and worker
  execution over active etalons; nested benchmark judge output contract;
  precision/recall/F1 scoring with partial-match reporting; persisted benchmark
  report JSON; and frontend pages for etalons, annotation, benchmark launch, and
  benchmark results.
- 2026-06-08: Implemented Phase 5 admin/audit/hardening slice. Added admin
  sections for documents, analyses, skills, etalons, benchmarks, and feedback;
  centralized audit recording with secret redaction; request/job/provider
  structured logging; reproducibility contract tests; MVP acceptance checklist;
  root `make test`; and the initial Playwright e2e spec/preflight.
- 2026-06-08: Closed MVP acceptance testing. Added Playwright as a web dev
  dependency, expanded the e2e spec into the full admin/user document-analysis
  flow, made the e2e runner start the production Next.js build automatically,
  excluded e2e specs from Vitest, ignored Playwright artifacts, and verified
  `make test` end-to-end: 106 backend/worker tests, 16 frontend unit tests,
  Next.js production build, Docker Compose config, and the full Playwright MVP
  flow pass.
- 2026-06-08: Aligned user-selectable document types to the current Gate
  Challenger skill stages: `gate_2`, `stream_review_1`,
  `stream_review_2_plus`, and `gate_3`. Kept `unknown` as the internal
  auto-detection fallback, removed old Gate 1/progress/strategy/generic stream
  options from selection, updated deterministic detection and baseline skill
  source path to `skills/gate-challenger/SKILL.md`, and verified API, worker,
  frontend unit tests plus web production build.
- 2026-06-08: Added soft-delete API coverage for documents, users, and admin
  etalons. Deletes mark rows as `deleted`, preserve artifacts/history, filter
  active user-facing lists, and record `document.deleted`, `user.deleted`, and
  `etalon.deleted` audit events.
- 2026-06-08: Added local SOCKS5 outbound proxy support for API/worker runtime
  and Python image builds through `OUTBOUND_PROXY_URL`. Provider adapters now
  pass proxy-aware HTTP clients for OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic-compatible, and
  Hermes calls while respecting `NO_PROXY` for local service hosts. Verified
  worker/API tests, Compose config, Python image build, and worker-container
  SOCKS availability.
- 2026-06-09: Implemented the dark enterprise frontend redesign from generated
  prototypes. AppShell now uses a sidebar workspace layout and the main MVP
  screens use dark graphite panels, dense tables, evidence workbench layouts,
  benchmark QA dashboards, and animated upload/loading affordances. Review
  fixes preserved full parsed text traceability, clarified document readiness
  vs verdict labeling, and made annotation JSON editors tolerate invalid draft
  input without discarding edits. Full e2e exposed an analysis-contract vs
  etalon-draft payload mismatch, so draft creation now maps current Gate
  Challenger Layer 1/2 output into annotation payload fields while preserving
  the older etalon-shaped input. Verified API etalon tests, frontend unit
  tests, production build, Compose config, independent review/tester agents,
  login browser smoke, and the full Playwright MVP flow.
- 2026-06-09: Fixed dark redesign responsiveness after browser review. Replaced
  document-page `100vw` width calculations with container-relative widths,
  compacted the mobile topbar/navigation, and converted the documents table to
  card rows on tablet/phone widths. Verified no page-level horizontal overflow
  at 1280, 1024, 768, 390, 360, and 320 px; frontend tests, production build,
  and the full Playwright MVP flow pass.
- 2026-06-10: Reordered analysis runtime so Devil's Advocate now runs as a
  pre-Gate expert critique inside `run_analysis`. The completed DA run remains
  persisted in `predicted_comment_runs`, and its `brutal_truth` plus
  `detected_contradictions` are stored in
  `analyses.run_parameters.gate_challenger_layer_4_context` and injected into
  the Gate Challenger prompt as Layer 4 expert context to strengthen or
  supplement document-grounded Gate findings.
- 2026-06-10: Fixed local Docker Start Analysis failures with
  `git command failed: rev-parse HEAD`. The API now defaults missing
  `snapshot_mode` to `development_current` when `APP_ENV=development`, so
  mounted external skill directories without usable git metadata can still be
  snapshotted for local testing while non-development defaults remain
  `production_latest`.
- 2026-06-10: Restored the analysis result short-summary presentation by
  rendering `analyses.summary` / `structured_output.summary` as a dedicated
  `short summary` block above Gate Challenger markdown, while stripping only
  the leading `Оценка документа` / `Document assessment` heading from the
  lower narrative block. Verified with the new focused display-helper test, all
  frontend unit tests, the production frontend build, rebuilt local web
  container, and a browser check of analysis
  `ef79c6fa-826e-417f-b601-0d21d2f9df3f`.
- 2026-06-10: Reduced oversized markdown `#` headings inside analysis outputs
  by scoping the markdown preview heading rules above page-level analysis
  heading styles, so model-supplied report titles no longer inherit the main
  page title size. Verified with frontend unit tests, production frontend
  build, and rebuilt local web container.
- 2026-06-10: Root-caused extra `title`, `impact`, and `recommendation` blocks
  in Gate Challenger Layer 1 to the local main-analysis JSON Schema and prompt,
  not the UI renderer. Updated the Layer 1 schema/prompt to require only
  `id`, `severity`, `issue`, and `evidence`, added a contract test rejecting
  the old expanded Layer 1 shape, and refreshed affected mock provider outputs.
  Verified with targeted API/worker tests and full `apps/api/tests` +
  `apps/worker/tests`; rebuilt the local worker container.
- 2026-06-10: Audited local Gate Challenger and Devil's Advocate renderers
  against their external skill sources. Key drift points: Gate output is forced
  into a service JSON contract and DA prepass is injected into Gate as Layer 4;
  Devil's Advocate is normalized to JSON/native markdown instead of producing
  annotated `.docx` comments, and the current `full_ic_voting` naming differs
  from older plan text that used `ic_voting_full`.
- 2026-06-11: Applied the new Paper light enterprise redesign across the main
  frontend surfaces: app shell, documents list/detail, analysis result,
  benchmarks list/detail, login, markdown, tables, forms, statuses, and nested
  Layer 1/Layer 2 result blocks. Added a frontend token regression test,
  rebuilt the local web container, and verified desktop/mobile browser views
  have the Paper light background without visible dark legacy blocks or
  horizontal overflow. Rebuilt the worker container after confirming it still
  had the stale main-analysis schema without `layer_2.status`; updated the e2e
  MVP fixture to the tightened Layer 1 contract and current tabbed Devil's
  Advocate UI. Verified `npm --prefix apps/web run test`, `npm --prefix
  apps/web run build`, and the full Playwright MVP flow against
  `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Backend contract pytest could not run in the host or
  runtime api container because pytest/dev dependencies are not installed
  there.
- 2026-07-10: Debugged a local document parsing stall after rebuilding the
  frontend/API stack. The web and API containers were healthy, but the worker
  service was not running, leaving the uploaded document queued in Redis. Started
  and rebuilt the worker container; the queued `.docx` parse completed, the
  document moved to `parse_status=completed`, Redis document queue drained to
  zero, and local web/API checks returned HTTP 200 on `127.0.0.1`.
- 2026-07-10: Fixed local `ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED` failures on
  `http://localhost:3000` after tracing them to broken IPv6 localhost forwarding
  in the Docker/Colima port binding. Updated local Compose to publish API/web on
  `127.0.0.1` and to use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` as the public API base URL.
  Recreated API/web containers and verified both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`
  return HTTP 200 for the document page and API docs.
- 2026-07-10: Fixed local Start Analysis precondition
  `No active main analysis skill is available`. Root cause was an empty local
  `skills` table after reinitializing local users/documents. Added local Compose
  IC Agentic Review source mount/env so baseline seeding has all external
  sources, recreated API/worker containers, ran `app.seeds.skills`, and verified
  six active baseline skills including `gate2_challenger_main_analysis`.
- 2026-07-10: Fixed local Start Analysis `Failed to fetch` caused by API 500
  during skill source snapshot creation. The local database was still at
  Alembic `202606180001` while the code expected `202607090001`, so
  `skill_source_snapshots.analysis_check_run_id` was missing. Ran
  `alembic upgrade head` in the API container and verified snapshot creation for
  `gate-challenger` succeeds in a rollback smoke test.
- 2026-07-10: Root-caused missing Devil's Advocate output on analysis
  `4878a5fa-fbf6-4049-97cb-a889b9939896` to document typing, not DA runtime.
  The uploaded document was `detected_document_type=unknown` with no manual
  override, so the DA prepass skipped the `devils_advocate_predefense` skill
  and no `predicted_comment_run` was created. Fixed the document detail launch
  payload to prefer `manual_document_type` over `detected_document_type` and
  verified the focused frontend tests pass.
- 2026-07-11: Repaired production IC review run
  `d72a6c2f-ba17-4133-881e-f68753f60745` for analysis
  `713193a4-740f-4efd-b9e5-865247afd0d4` without rerunning completed roles.
  Rebuilt/recreated the production worker with role output maxLength
  normalization, normalized the saved `ic-tech-dd` raw output to structured
  output, resumed only the missing `ic-risk-scenario` and synthesis/postprocess
  stages, and verified the run is `completed` with 8/8 role steps completed,
  9 artifacts, validation `warn` with 0 failures, and production health
  returning HTTP 200.
- 2026-07-14: Added the `Result` tab short summary block directly under the
  final verdict and aligned its background with the Gate Challenger short
  summary treatment (`#f7f9fb` with `#e5eaf0` border) while keeping text
  `#161616`. Verified focused frontend tests (`23 passed`), rebuilt/restarted
  the local web container, and confirmed the analysis detail page returns HTTP
  200.
- 2026-07-14: Added the baseline `result_summary_synthesis` skill and worker
  synthesis step that runs after a completed IC Agentic Review. The step
  extracts Gate Challenger recommendations plus the IC Review executive brief,
  calls the configured provider with `contracts/schemas/result-short-summary`
  JSON output, and stores the merged Result tab summary at
  `analysis.structured_output.result.short_summary`; the frontend now prefers
  that value before legacy Gate summary fallbacks. Seeded the local DB with the
  new skill, rebuilt/restarted API/worker/web, verified frontend tests (`43
  passed`), Python compile/smoke checks, and container health. Runtime images
  still do not include `pytest`, so backend/worker pytest files were added but
  could not be executed inside the current containers.
- 2026-07-14: Added reproducible Docker pytest support without adding dev
  dependencies to runtime images. API and worker Dockerfiles now accept
  `INSTALL_DEV=true`, and `infra/docker-compose.test.yml` defines `api-test`
  and `worker-test` services that install optional dev extras and run pytest.
  Documented the commands in `README.md`. Verified
  `docker compose --env-file .env -f infra/docker-compose.test.yml config`,
  full API pytest (`180 passed`), and full worker pytest (`137 passed`).
  Fixed brittle skill-index test fixtures to select seeded skills by name and
  updated worker mock Gate Challenger outputs to the current summary schema.
- 2026-07-14: Backfilled Result tab `Short Summary` for local analysis
  `964e2d93-902d-409b-9593-008238fe1dbc` using the same
  `result_summary_synthesis` worker path that runs after completed IC Review.
  Verified `analysis.structured_output.result.short_summary_status=completed`
  and the local web container serves the analysis page.
- 2026-07-14: Added a white auto-sized Result tab surface around the verdict
  and short-summary blocks so the outer container grows with whatever Result
  content is present. Verified focused frontend tests (`analysisPage`, 21
  passed), rebuilt/restarted the local web container, and confirmed the
  analysis page is served by the updated web image.
- 2026-07-14: Added Result tab rationale synthesis from Gate Challenger
  `Почему оценка именно такая` plus IC Review `Top findings`, with appended
  `Critical risks` and `Data gaps`. Added
  `contracts/schemas/result-rationale.schema.json`, seeded the inline
  `result_rationale_synthesis` skill, wired worker execution after completed
  IC Review, and rendered the new `Почему оценка именно такая` block inside the
  auto-sized Result surface. Verified API schema/seed tests (`31 passed`),
  focused worker synthesis/job tests (`26 passed`), focused web tests
  (`42 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `api`/`worker`/`web`, seeded the
  local DB, backfilled analysis `964e2d93-902d-409b-9593-008238fe1dbc`, and
  confirmed the analysis page is served by the updated web image.
- 2026-07-14: Reworked the analysis detail output tabs into a two-level
  structure: top-level `Executive Summary` and `Full Report`, with the former
  Result panel reused as `Executive Summary`; `Full Report` now contains nested
  `Gate Challenger`, `Document comments`, `IC review`, and `Full Output` tabs.
  The defaults are `Executive Summary` and nested `Gate Challenger`. Verified
  focused web tests (`43 passed`), confirmed Next compile/typecheck reaches the
  known pre-existing `/404` `<Html>` prerender failure, rebuilt/restarted the
  local `web` container, and confirmed the analysis page is served.
- 2026-07-14: Reworked document detail `Start analysis` into a full-package
  launch: the Gate Challenger worker flow still runs Devil's Advocate/predicted
  comments, then automatically creates and enqueues IC Review after the Gate run
  completes, using a linked valid `.xlsx` Fin Summary when available. The
  document detail UI now keeps users on the page, shows a running-package
  progress panel, disables duplicate launches, polls until Gate Challenger,
  Devil's Advocate, and IC Review are complete, and only then shows the
  completed package in the analysis history list. Verified Python compile,
  focused worker tests (`12 passed`), focused web document tests (`32 passed`),
  focused API IC/document tests (`38 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local
  `api`/`worker`/`web`, and confirmed `/health` plus `/documents` return 200.
- 2026-07-14: Changed the primary `/documents` upload action into `Start
  Analysis`: the page now uploads the defense document plus optional Fin
  Summary, polls the uploaded primary document until parsing completes, starts
  the same full-package analysis flow used by the document detail page with the
  configured default provider/model, then opens the document detail page to show
  full-package progress. Added focused web coverage for the upload-to-analysis
  orchestration. Verified focused document web tests (`34 passed`),
  rebuilt/restarted the local `web` container, confirmed `/documents` returns
  200, and confirmed Next dev compiled `/documents` successfully. A direct
  `tsc --noEmit` still reaches pre-existing test-fixture type errors in
  `analysisDisplay.test.ts` and `provider-settings.test.ts`.
- 2026-07-14: Reworked the `/documents` table from uploaded-document rows into
  completed case rows. The first column is now `Case`, the per-file format badge
  is removed, rows are shown only after the latest analysis package has completed
  Gate Challenger, Devil's Advocate, and IC Review, and each row's `Open` action
  now links directly to `/analyses/{analysis_id}`. Added focused web coverage
  for the completed-case table behavior. Verified focused document web tests
  (`35 passed`), rebuilt/restarted the local `web` container, confirmed
  `/documents` returns 200, and confirmed Next dev compiled `/documents`.
- 2026-07-14: Adjusted the `/documents` case table to keep in-progress cases
  visible after analysis launch. The table now stores the latest analysis per
  document, shows a dedicated `Analysis` status column for Gate Challenger,
  Devil's Advocate, IC Review, completed, or failed states, and disables `Open`
  until the full package is complete. Verified focused document web tests
  (`35 passed`), rebuilt/restarted the local `web` container, and confirmed
  `/documents` returns 200.
- 2026-07-14: Clarified `/documents` case-table status semantics for linked Fin
  Summary workbooks. `.xlsx` Fin Summary attachments now display as `Workbook
  attached` instead of surfacing the generic document parser's unsupported-file
  failure, avoiding conflict with the real analysis status column where IC
  Review can continue running from the workbook file. Verified the local Avito
  Sales case has a completed primary `.docx`, a linked `.xlsx` Fin Summary with
  generic parser failure, and an IC Review run in progress. Verified focused
  document web tests (`35 passed`), rebuilt/restarted `web`, and confirmed
  `/documents` returns 200.
- 2026-07-15: Investigated the local Avito Sales IC Review failure and found
  the IC run failed with `job_timeout_exception` almost exactly at the previous
  30-minute RQ timeout while still reporting the coarse `preparing_context`
  stage. Increased IC agentic review enqueue timeout to 2 hours and split the
  early worker stage reporting into `loading_snapshot`, `extracting_workbook`,
  `formula_audit`, and `building_context` so future slowdowns identify whether
  the time is spent in workbook extraction, original-skill formula audit, or
  final context assembly. Added focused API coverage for the IC timeout setting.
  Verified Python compile, focused API timeout test (`1 passed`), focused IC
  worker job tests (`25 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `api` and `worker`,
  and confirmed API health from inside the container (`{"status":"ok"}`).
- 2026-07-15: Updated the `/documents` case table actions so the completed
  analysis link is labeled `Analysis results` and still remains disabled until
  the full package completes, while a new `Open Case` action opens the original
  document/case detail page in a new tab. Verified focused web coverage
  (`uploadStartAnalysis.test.ts`, `2 passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `web`,
  and confirmed `/documents` returns 200 from inside the web container.
- 2026-07-15: Investigated the new Avito Sales IC Review failure
  `invalid_json:Unterminated string starting at` and found it occurred in the
  first role step (`failed:ic-financial-auditor`), not synthesis. The failed
  step sent a very large prompt (`261124` input tokens) and hit the exact
  previous role output cap (`12000` output tokens), leaving an unterminated JSON
  string. Fixed the root causes by compacting workbook context for LLM prompts,
  removing duplicate workbook context injection from role prompts, raising IC
  role output budget to `32000`, and adding a role-level invalid-JSON retry
  without rerunning completed roles. Measured the real Avito role prompt path:
  old saved prompt was about `812k` characters; the new rendered equivalent is
  about `132k` characters, with workbook context about `30k` and no duplicate
  `## Workbook Context` block. Verified Python compile, focused worker tests
  (`test_ic_review_renderer.py` + `test_run_ic_agentic_review_job.py`, `42
  passed`), rebuilt/restarted local `worker`, and confirmed the running worker
  uses role output limit `32000`.
